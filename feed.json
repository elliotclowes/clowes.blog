Well this delivers in this department.\n\nAfter \"Air\" you should watch:\n- [The Last Dance](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-last-dance), a documentary about Michael Jordan.\n- [BlackBerry](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/blackberry), another 'business film'. It's another solid film you might have missed..\n\n**71%**\n\n[Find out where to stream it](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/air-2023).  \n[This review is also on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/elliotclowes/film/air-2023/).\n",

But the reality is that science and AI have little in common and AI is unlikely to make science obsolete. The core of science is theoretical models that anyone can use to make reliable descriptions and predictions.</p>\n<p>The core of AI, in contrast, is, as Anderson noted, data mining: ransacking large databases for statistical patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The hype around AI replacing science is getting a bit out of hand. This article does a cracking job of puncturing that bubble a bit.</p>\n<p>The core argument is spot on: science is about building theoretical models that anyone can use to make reliable predictions. AI, on the other hand, is just glorified data mining - finding patterns without necessarily understanding why they exist.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that AI isn&rsquo;t useful in science - it clearly is. But it&rsquo;s a tool, not a replacement for the scientific method. The real test is whether AI actually leads to new products and services being developed faster and cheaper. So far, the evidence is pretty thin on the ground.</p>\n<p>The most telling quote comes from the CEO of an AI-powered drug company: &ldquo;People are saying, AI will solve everything. They give you fancy words. We&rsquo;ll ingest all of this longitudinal data and we&rsquo;ll do latitudinal analysis. It&rsquo;s all garbage. It&rsquo;s just hype.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>AI might be changing the world, but let&rsquo;s not get carried away. Science isn&rsquo;t going anywhere.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd114lllyp6o\">BBC News</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This year, software firm 37signals will see a profit boost of more than $1m (¬£790,000) from leaving the cloud.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To be able to get that with such relatively modest changes to our business is astounding,&rdquo; says co-owner and chief technology officer, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH). &ldquo;Seeing the bill on a weekly basis really radicalised me.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://37signals.com/\">37signals</a>, the company behind <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/\">Hey</a>, has moved away from cloud services and seen a significant boost to their bottom line as a result.</p>\n<p>For 37signals, owning hardware and using a shared data centre has proven substantially cheaper than renting cloud resources. But cost isn&rsquo;t the only factor at play. DHH also raises concerns about the internet&rsquo;s resilience when so much of it relies on just three major cloud providers.</p>\n<p>This trend isn&rsquo;t limited to 37signals. The BBC reports that 94% of large US organisations have repatriated some workloads from the cloud in the last three years, claiming issues like security, unexpected costs, and performance problems.</p>\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re a company using a lot of storage and bandwidth the cloud can be incredibly expensive. There&rsquo;s a reason <a href=\"https://ayushhsinghh.medium.com/case-study-how-netflix-is-using-aws-and-its-own-cdn-64ca6282eda0\">Netflix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire/\">Dropbox</a> use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">AWS</a> for things like metadata, but use their own servers for large files.</p>\n<p>That said, cloud computing obviously isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. The key takeaway comes from Mark Turner at Pulsant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The change leaders in the IT industry are now the people who are not saying cloud first, but are saying cloud when it fits. Five years ago, the change disruptors were cloud first, cloud first, cloud first.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems we&rsquo;re moving towards a more nuanced approach. The future might not be all-cloud or all on-premises, but a mix of both. A sensible evolution I&rsquo;d say.</p>\n",

We&rsquo;re just too complicated, so we shoehorn in mechanical parallels:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his book In Our Own Image (2015), the artificial intelligence expert George Zarkadakis describes six different metaphors people have employed over the past 2,000 years to try to explain human intelligence.</p>\n<p>In the earliest one, eventually preserved in the Bible, humans were formed from clay or dirt, which an intelligent god then infused with its spirit&hellip;</p>\n<p>The invention of hydraulic engineering in the 3rd century BCE led to the popularity of a hydraulic model of human intelligence, the idea that the flow of different fluids in the body ‚Äì the ‚Äòhumours‚Äô ‚Äì accounted for both our physical and mental functioning. The hydraulic metaphor persisted for more than 1,600 years, handicapping medical practice all the while.</p>\n<p>By the 1500s, automata powered by springs and gears had been devised, eventually inspiring leading thinkers such as Ren√© Descartes to assert that humans are complex machines. In the 1600s, the British philosopher Thomas Hobbes suggested that thinking arose from small mechanical motions in the brain. By the 1700s, discoveries about electricity and chemistry led to new theories of human intelligence ‚Äì again, largely metaphorical in nature&hellip;</p>\n<p>The mathematician John von Neumann stated flatly that the function of the human nervous system is ‚Äòprima facie digital‚Äô, drawing parallel after parallel between the components of the computing machines of the day and the components of the human brain</p>\n<p>Each metaphor reflected the most advanced thinking of the era that spawned it. Predictably, just a few years after the dawn of computer technology in the 1940s, the brain was said to operate like a computer, with the role of physical hardware played by the brain itself and our thoughts serving as software&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about digitising a brain?:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even if we had the ability to take a snapshot of all of the brain‚Äôs 86 billion neurons and then to simulate the state of those neurons in a computer, that vast pattern would mean nothing outside the body of the brain that produced it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br><p><b>Permalink:</b> <a href=\"https://blot.blog/2024/06/20/your-brain-is-not-a-computer/\">https://blot.blog/2024/06/20/your-brain-is-not-a-computer/</a></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Like a lot of bloggers I have a small, but <em>quiet</em> audience. So I&rsquo;m a fan of using analytics to see who&rsquo;s visiting my site. It&rsquo;s a delight to discover the various corners of the globe that have stumbled upon my writings.</p>\n<p>However, most analytics tools don&rsquo;t cater to this niche market. Google Analytics (GA) is the behemoth of tracking ‚Äì it&rsquo;s free but overkill, privacy-invading, and has a confusing web interface. Other choices are limited and often expensive, charging ¬£10-¬£20/month, which isn&rsquo;t justifiable for many small bloggers like myself.</p>\n<p>As a result I simply haven&rsquo;t used or cared about analytics for many years. The last time I regularly used one was when <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130327075313/http://www.haveamint.com/\">Mint</a> was <a href=\"https://initialcharge.net/2016/12/goodbye-mint-fever/\">still alive</a>.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I was thrilled to discover <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">Tinylytics</a>. Their free plan offers 1,000 page hits/month, which is perfect for many bloggers. And if you need more, their paid plan is a very reasonable $5/month ‚Äì a price I&rsquo;d gladly pay.</p>\n<p>And one of the best features is that you can track up to 5 sites on the free plan and unlimited sites on the paid plan. As a web tinkerer with multiple small sites, this is a game-changer for me.</p>\n<p>Also I love the page that explains <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/why-a-free-plan\">why they offer a free plan</a>, as it pretty much sums up what I&rsquo;ve been saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of analytics software is too expensive. Period. Heck, I just started a small side project or a personal site and I don&rsquo;t want to shell out $9 - $14 per month just for analytics that looks pretty.<br>\n[&hellip;]<br>\nThere are free options from big providers, but guess what&hellip; they&rsquo;re probably using your data to better meet their own needs and most likely advertisers.<br>\n[&hellip;]<br>\nHaving a free plan, from someone that deeply cares, and from an individual, not a huge corporate or venture funded company, is the best start you can give yourself without worrying what will happen with your data. It sits on my server, and is backed up hourly to an offsite encrypted backup. That&rsquo;s it. Oh and you won&rsquo;t break the bank either. I think that&rsquo;s a win win.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a small blogger looking for an affordable, privacy-focused, and user-friendly analytics solution, I highly recommend giving <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">Tinylytics</a> a try.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imlefthanded.com/image/tinylytics-min.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",

I thought this passage on Virginia Woolf‚Äôs depression treatment interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf\">Virginia Woolf</a>, on the other hand, was in the 1920s treated, if that is the right word, by the then recommended regime of complete rest ‚Äì not even books were allowed, lest they excite the brain ‚Äì milk, weight gain, fresh air and early nights. One of her doctors, Sir George Savage, was especially keen to treat neurasthenic women by excessive feeding and complete rest. Woolf was given four or five pints of milk every day, half a pint every two hours. After five days of milk on this scale, she was allowed to add a cutlet, malt extract, cod liver oil and beef tea. The rather brainless thinking behind the regime was that since patients like Woolf stopped eating and lost weight when depressed, they could be forced back into wellness by being made to gain weight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imagine having depression and your ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô is being forced to do nothing and drink loads of milk.</p>\n<p>Side note. I like this picture of her. She looks so very <em>human</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blot.blog/image/virginia-woolf.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/virginia-woolf-min.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n",

I thought they might be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù as in having their price controlled by the government. But it‚Äôs actually the precursor to the food pyramid idea.</p>\n<p>One poster I found promoting it suggests this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PINT MILK, 1 EGG, 1 POTATO AND TWO OTHER VEGETABLES (ONE OF THESE A GREEN LEAFY ONE), 2 SERVINGS OF FRUIT (AT LEAST ONE RAW), 1 SERVING OF MEAT OR FISH, 1 OZ. BUTTER.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I think it still holds up. Could it be improved? Probably. But it‚Äôs simple and realistic. I like it.</p>\n<p>People often overthink diet. So I like simplicity.

Surveying nearly 75,000 adults, researchers discovered that both morning and night types who stayed up late had higher rates of mental disorders. Surprisingly, aligning with one‚Äôs chronotype didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîearly bedtimes benefited everyone. The study suggests lights out by 1 a.m. for better mental health.</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] ‚ÄúThe worst-case scenario is definitely the late-night people staying up late,‚Äù Zeitzer said. Night owls being true to their chronotype were 20% to 40% more likely to have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder, compared with night owls following an early or intermediate sleep schedule.</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] They also tested the possibility that it was poor mental health causing people to stay up late, not the other way around. They tracked a subset of participants who had no previous diagnosis of a mental disorder for the next eight years.</p>\n<p>During that time, night owls who slept late were the most likely to develop a mental health disorder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed this ‚Äì anecdotally. I&rsquo;m a natural night owl, but I feel at my worst when I go to bed late.</p>\n<p>I feel happier and healthier when in an earlier pattern. But I find it tough to remain in that pattern. My body and brain is constantly asking me to stay up later. And once or twice a week I&rsquo;ll really struggle to get to sleep.</p>\n<p>One thing that study didn&rsquo;t look into  is wether the increase of mental health issues is caused by what people do late at night, rather than just being awake late:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There may be many explanations for sleep timing‚Äôs link to mental well-being, but [the studies author] thinks it likely comes down to the poor decisions that people make in the wee hours of the morning.</p>\n<p>Many harmful behaviors are more common at night, including suicidal thinking, violent crimes, alcohol and drug use, and overeating.</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] His team plans to examine whether particular late-night behaviors, rather than timing per se, are linked to poor mental health.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my case the bad outcomes seem to be caused by the staying up late, not what I do in those late hours.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Want to be known as dependable and great at your job? Focus on the big and the small tasks.</p>\n<p>People notice when that critical project is struggling. They also notice when you promise a small favour but take forever to deliver.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to tackle the medium tasks first. The small ones can wait until later. But suddenly it&rsquo;s the end of the day and they&rsquo;re not done.</p>\n<p>And the big projects feel overwhelming, so you wait for the perfect time to start. Which never arrives.</p>\n<p>So you spend most of your time on those hour-long tasks, neglecting the day-long ones and the 10 minute favours.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve fallen into this trap. But I&rsquo;ve learned that to be seen as reliable and effective, you need to prioritise the big and the small and get them done first.</p>\n<p>Break up that big, daunting project into a bunch of different tasks and treat them as totally separate pieces of work.</p>\n<p>When someone asks for a quick favour, do it quickly. So create time in your calendar. Choose one of the below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>5-10 minutes every hour.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>A good cadence if you like a &lsquo;break&rsquo; every so often and can pick up right where you left off after the 5-10 minutes are over.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>10-20 minutes 3 times a day.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>11:00, after you&rsquo;ve finished your 09:00-11:00 focus period.</li>\n<li>13:30, after lunch when your energy is low.</li>\n<li>16:45, right before the end of the day. Your desire to be done for the day will mean you will do those tasks <em>fast</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>45-60 minutes once a day.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Do it in the post-lunch crash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The medium tasks won&rsquo;t make or break your reputation. But nailing the big projects and small details? That&rsquo;s how you become the go-to person at work.</p>\n",

Almost no destination has a pain/novelty ratio that makes it worth it&hellip; Even though travel has gotten way more convenient overall (smartphones, eSIM cards, cashless payments, Uber, Google Translate ‚Äî though at the expense of phone-loss anxiety), my tolerance for discomfort has plummeted. I don‚Äôt like shitty hotels/hostels, awkward couchsurfing, wrangling luggage, driving unfamiliar cars, figuring out transit systems&hellip; I especially don‚Äôt like wading through lots of options figuring out food options. The net effect is that I‚Äôve gradually gone sessile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I used to think I was supposed to love travel. Everyone else seems to. But I&rsquo;ve realised it&rsquo;s just not my thing.</p>\n<p>I like the <em>idea</em>. Seeing the world, trying new things. And I love travel shows ‚Äì <em><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/anthony-bourdain-parts-unknown\">Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</a></em> is a favourite. But the reality doesn&rsquo;t live up to the hype for me.</p>\n<p>Unknown places? No thanks. Spending tons of money? Pass. Flying? Hate it.</p>\n<p>Every trip I feel a sense of dread and regret for booking it. Even visiting somewhere great, like my upcoming Seville trip, I&rsquo;m just not that excited.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t hate travel.

There&rsquo;s so much pressure to love travel.</p>\n<p>Maybe when I&rsquo;m old I&rsquo;ll regret not traveling more.

				"content_text": "<p>I used to be a newsletter hater. My email inbox is a wasteland of work, spam and things I don&rsquo;t care about. It&rsquo;s not the place I go to when I want to be entertained or delighted. And¬†why would I use email when I have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a>?</p>\n<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know, an RSS &lsquo;feed&rsquo; is essentially a plain text version of a blog that an RSS &lsquo;reader&rsquo; will then process and nicely display for you.¬†It&rsquo;s an ad-free, dedicated reading place with no tracking, offline functionality (once synced), and customisable font size, text width, etc.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s great. And during the heyday¬†of blogging it was a popular way to read blogs as you didn&rsquo;t have to visit a site to get new posts. But when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader\">Google Reader</a>, the most popular RSS reader, shut down in 2013, it effectively killed off RSS for mainstream users. Its usage has been declining ever since, and blogging declined with it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile social media rose and people shifted from writing on blogs to Twitter. Gone were the days of a chronological list of blog posts, neatly organised in folders, and in its place was an endless feed, organised by opaque algorithms designed to maximise engagement at any cost. It was sad.</p>\n<p>So when I started comparing newsletters as an <em>alternative</em> to social media rather than a <em>replacement</em> for RSS I began to see them more fondly ‚Äì and even root for them. Because to encourage people to consume higher-quality writing and spend less time on social media, there needs to be a good, easy alternative. RSS isn&rsquo;t it. Email is.</p>\n<p>In many ways, email is similar to an RSS reader. Both have read/unread flags, folders/labels, less ads and tracking compared to the web, and customisable font sizes if you&rsquo;re using an email client.</p>\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of writers getting paid. For years writers struggled to make money on the web. They could maybe make a bit of money via ads, sponsored¬†posts or membership schemes. But they needed a lot more than <a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\">1000 true fans</a> support themselves because there wasn&rsquo;t a system or a culture for those fans to pay them. Email newsletters solve this problem, as every newsletter platform allows writers to charge subscribers. And with the rise of <a href=\"https://substack.com/\">Substack</a> and paid newsletters in general, people are more accustomed to paying.</p>\n<p>Older web users like myself may still pine for the RSS glory days and look down on newsletters and email as a poor alternative. But the fact is they are a practical way for people to read and a viable way for writers to find an audience and get paid for their work.</p>\n",

His first two, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/lock-stock-and-two-smoking-barrels\">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/snatch\">Snatch</a>&rdquo;, are the business. Even as he&rsquo;s gone more Hollywood over the years, his work always maintains that unique Ritchie touch ‚Äì the clever dialogue, the inventive filming style. His Sherlock Holmes felt fresh and modern, despite the period setting. And &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-man-from-u-n-c-l-e\">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a>&rdquo; was a blast. Even when he slightly misses the mark, like with &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword\">King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</a>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/wrath-of-man\">Wrath of Man</a>&rdquo; (a poor man&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/heat\">Heat</a>&rdquo;), there&rsquo;s still enough Ritchie magic to make them worth a watch. His &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/aladdin-2019\">Aladdin</a>&rdquo; was okayish too. Really, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/five-eyes\">Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre</a>&rdquo; is his only true dud (even the title is bad).</p>\n<p>So, I was excited for &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-ministry-of-ungentlemanly-warfare\">The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</a>&rdquo;. The premise is great, revolving around a secret British commando unit formed during World War II to carry out covert operations against the Nazis. And the first hour was exactly what I wanted from a lazy Sunday flick. It was quintessentially English, almost to the point of parody, and it moved at a cracking pace. I love a good mercenary team-up film, and this one delivered.</p>\n<p>Well for the first hour or so. As the second half of the film doesn&rsquo;t quite stick the landing. The villain feels underutilised and not quite menacing enough. The fight scenes, which initially impressed with their stylish effortlessness, start to feel a bit repetitive and lack any real tension. You never doubt that our heroes will come out on top, which saps the stakes from the numerous altercations and the final <em>big</em> fight. The last hour just drags a bit, and I found my attention wandering.</p>\n<p>Despite these issues, &ldquo;The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&rdquo; is still a really solid film. It&rsquo;s a fun, old-fashioned adventure that feels like a throwback in the best way. It reminded me of a combination of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/raiders-of-the-lost-ark\">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/operation-mincemeat\">Operation Mincemeat</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-wild-geese\">The Wild Geese</a>&rdquo;.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><strong>April 12, 1835. London.</strong> The weekly Friday lottery draw is about to take place and a young woman clutches her ticket with desperate hope as she speeds up Denmark Hill.</p>\n<p>A ticket is difficult to get as it all but guarantees that you&rsquo;ll see a favourable outcome in the draw. So every morning for the past three days the woman visited various wealthy homes, begging the servant who answered the door to let her see their master so she can plead her case for her worthiness of a ticket. And eventually she was thankfully gifted one.</p>\n<p>However, once she arrives at her destination the staff on the door tell her the draw started ten minutes ago and they won&rsquo;t admit her. She begs, telling them it&rsquo;s a matter of life and death. But she&rsquo;s simply reminded about the importance of punctuality to this establishment and asked to leave.</p>\n<p>Dejected and distraught, she leaves the building and the city of London and returns to her home in the countryside. A few days later she dies.</p>\n<p>The young woman ‚Äì The Times reported ‚Äì was suffering from a fistula, inflammation of the brain, and consumption. The ticket was to give her the chance of admission to King&rsquo;s College Hospital. She&rsquo;d been at the hospital earlier in the week, showing symptoms like abnormal discharge, fever, headache, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath and swelling. However, she was turned away. It was a Monday, and she was instructed to return on Friday&rsquo;s &ldquo;taking in day&rdquo; ‚Äî the sole day of the week when new patients were accepted.</p>\n<p>Lindsey Fitzharris in her book <a href=\"https://drlindseyfitzharris.com/the-butchering-art/\">The Butchering Art</a> tell us more:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;In the nineteenth century, almost all the hospitals in London except the Royal Free controlled inpatient admission through a system of ticketing. One could obtain a ticket from one of the hospital&rsquo;s &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo;, who had paid an annual fee in exchange for the right to recommend patients to the hospital and vote in elections of medical staff. Securing a ticket required tireless soliciting on the part of potential patients.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ticketing system was just one of the many cruel and arbitrary features of 19th-century London hospitals. Governors, not medical staff, determined which patients were admitted. Patients were required to attend daily chapel services, facing the threat of going without food if they did not comply. Punishments were meted out for offenses like gambling, swearing, and drunkenness. No patient could be admitted more than once with the same disease, and those deemed &ldquo;incurable&rdquo;, such as those with cancer or tuberculosis, were turned away. As were those with venereal infections.</p>\n<p>The plight of this woman underscores the stark injustices of Victorian healthcare. It was an era where medical assistance was often a privilege reserved for the wealthy or well-connected, leaving countless people facing insurmountable barriers to treatment. And it serves as a reminder that despite the abolition of such Victorian healthcare systems, modern healthcare will still harbour poorly designed systems that perpetuate bias, cause needless delays, and foster negative outcomes.</p>\n",

Apps, to-do lists, life hacks ‚Äì we&rsquo;ll try anything to squeeze more into our days. But here&rsquo;s the kicker: it&rsquo;s a trap. The more efficient you become, the more you pile on. It&rsquo;s like trying to outrun your own shadow.</p>\n<p>This &ldquo;efficiency trap&rdquo; is a hamster wheel to nowhere. You run faster and faster, but you&rsquo;re still stuck in the same damn cage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The problem with trying to make time for everything that feels important‚Ä¶is that you definitely never will.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"creative-neglect\">Creative neglect</h2>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the alternative? Embrace your limitations. Accept that you can&rsquo;t do it all. Choose your battles. Burkeman calls it &ldquo;creative neglect.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This means saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; more often. Saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the things that don&rsquo;t matter, so you can say &ldquo;hell yes&rdquo; to the things that do. It means prioritising ruthlessly, focusing on what truly matters, and letting the rest go.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;If you don‚Äôt save a bit of your time for you, now, out of every week, there is no moment in the future when you‚Äôll magically be done with everything and have loads of free time.&rdquo; - Jessica Abel, quoted in Four Thousand Weeks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-antidote-to-our-speed-addiction\">The antidote to our speed addiction</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re addicted to speed. We want everything now. But life doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Good things take time. Relationships take time. Creativity takes time.</p>\n<p>Patience is the antidote to our speed addiction. It&rsquo;s about slowing down, being present, and appreciating the journey. It&rsquo;s about resisting the urge to rush and allowing things to unfold at their own pace.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The experience of patience‚Ä¶gives things a kind of chewiness‚Ä¶into which you can sink your teeth.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-joy-of-missing\">The joy of missing</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re terrified of missing out. FOMO is the plague of our generation. But here&rsquo;s the secret: missing out is inevitable. You can&rsquo;t do everything. You can&rsquo;t be everywhere. And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>\n<p>Embrace the FOMO. It&rsquo;s what makes your choices meaningful. It&rsquo;s what gives your life its unique flavour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;It‚Äôs precisely the fact that I could have chosen a different and perhaps equally valuable way to spend this afternoon that bestows meaning on the choice I did make.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"time-is-a-shared-experience\">Time is a shared experience</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re obsessed with individual achievement. But we forget that we&rsquo;re social creatures. We need each other. We thrive in community.</p>\n<p>Time is a shared experience. It&rsquo;s about synchronising with others, falling into rhythm, and creating a sense of belonging. It&rsquo;s about participating in rituals, traditions, and collective endeavours that bind us together.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;The more Swedes who were off work simultaneously, the happier people got‚Ä¶as if an intangible, supernatural cloud of relaxation had settled over the nation as a whole.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"this-is-it\">This is It</h2>\n<p>We avoid thinking about death. It&rsquo;s uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s scary. But denying it doesn&rsquo;t make it go away.</p>\n<p>Confronting your mortality is a wake-up call. It&rsquo;s a reminder that this is it.

Celebrate what you accomplish instead.</li>\n<li><strong>How:</strong> Each evening, jot down everything you finished, big or small. Savour the feeling of progress, not the pressure of what&rsquo;s left.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"week-2-time-is-yours-claim-it\">Week 2: Time is yours, claim it</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action:</strong> Schedule &ldquo;Creative Rendezvous&rdquo; with yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Why:</strong> Stop waiting for free time to appear. Make it happen.</li>\n<li><strong>How:</strong> Block out time in your calendar for your passions, just like you would for a meeting. Treat this time as sacred and non-negotiable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"week-3-stillness-is-the-new-hustle\">Week 3: Stillness is the new hustle</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action:</strong> Try &ldquo;Do Nothing&rdquo; meditation.</li>\n<li><strong>Why:</strong> We&rsquo;re addicted to doing.

It&rsquo;s harder than it sounds, but the calm is worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"week-4-enjoy-the-ride\">Week 4: Enjoy the ride</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action:</strong> Start an &ldquo;Atelic Adventure.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Why:</strong> We&rsquo;re obsessed with goals. Discover the joy of doing things just for the sake of doing them.</li>\n<li><strong>How:</strong> Pick a hobby you&rsquo;ve always wanted to try, and focus on enjoying the process, not achieving mastery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"week-5-give-now\">Week 5: Give now</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Action:</strong> Practice &ldquo;Instantaneous Generosity.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Why:</strong> Generosity and goodness is contagious. So start the chain reaction. It makes you and them feel good.</li>\n<li><strong>How:</strong> When you feel the urge to give someone a compliment or do something nice, do it immediately. Wether it be a total stranger or your wife of 50 years. Don&rsquo;t wait or get caught up in your head about how they&rsquo;ll take it or hold back because they said something mean that morning.

That&rsquo;s where growth happens.</li>\n<li><strong>How:</strong> Choose a challenge that pushes you outside your comfort zone. It&rsquo;s a cliche, but a true one.

I&rsquo;m back with the eighth instalment of <a href=\"https://blot.blog/tags/little-links-and-notes/\">Little Links & Notes</a>. Enjoy, and have a good week.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How I Went From Writing 2,000 Words a Day to 10,000 Words a Day&rdquo;</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sfwa.org/2011/12/14/guest-post-how-i-went-from-writing-2000-words-a-day-to-10000-words-a-day/\">Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers Association ‚Äì Rachel Aaron</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.sfwa.org_2011_12_14_guest-post-how-i-went-from-writing-2000-words-a-day-to-10000-words-a-day_.html\">¬∞</a>).</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a writer to enjoy this article on how this person used a &ldquo;Knowledge, Time, Enthusiasm&rdquo; triangle to improve her daily writing output.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how she did it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: Know what you&rsquo;re writing beforehand. In the past she knew roughly what she was writing about that day ‚Äì knowing the plot and the scenes ‚Äì but it wasn&rsquo;t throughly broken down, step by step. So she used to waste time finding those steps as she went, which was slow and often needed rewrites. So at the start of each writing session she&rsquo;d spend some time planning it out. He daily words went from 2K to 5K.</li>\n<li><strong>Time</strong>: She tracked her writing time and analysed patterns to identify the most productive times and writing locations for her. She realised that her words per hour was much higher with each extra hour she spent writing. Writing in short bursts didn&rsquo;t work. Also her output was higher away from her home. So she optimised for longer, uninterrupted stretches in locations without internet distractions.</li>\n<li><strong>Enthusiasm</strong>: Her statistics showed that her writing output was much higher for scenes she was excited to write. So she got my ruthless on what she included in her book. So she stopped writing any scenes she wasn&rsquo;t massively excited to write. &ldquo;If I had scenes that were boring enough that I didn‚Äôt want to write them, then there was no way in hell anyone would want to read them.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Is life more pain than pleasure?</strong> (<a href=\"https://smallpotatoes.paulbloom.net/p/life-is-good\">Small Potatoes ‚Äì Paul Bloom</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__smallpotatoes.paulbloom.net_p_life-is-good.html\">¬∞</a>).</p>\n<p>A look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism\">antinatalism</a> and the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benatar\">David Benatar</a> which both have the view that it is morally wrong to bring new sentient beings into existence because life inevitably involves more suffering than happiness or well-being.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s some interesting quotes from Benatar in this post, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Even in good health, much of every day is spent in discomfort. Within hours, we become thirsty and hungry. ‚Ä¶ When we can access food and beverage and thus succeed in warding off hunger and thirst for a while, we then come to feel the discomfort of distended bladders and bowels. ‚Ä¶ We also spend much of our time in thermal discomfort‚Äîfeeling either too hot or too cold. Unless one naps at the first sign of weariness, one spends quite a bit of the day feeling tired. Indeed, many people wake up tired and spend the day in that state. ‚Ä¶ Itches and allergies are common. Minor illnesses like colds are suffered by almost everybody. ‚Ä¶ Many women of reproductive years suffer regular menstrual pains and menopausal women suffer hot flashes. ‚Ä¶ Conditions such as nausea, hypoglycemia, seizures, and chronic pain are widespread.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] &ldquo;The most intense pleasures are short-lived, whereas the worst pains can be much more enduring. Orgasms, for example, pass quickly. Gastronomic pleasures last a bit longer, but even if the pleasure of good food is protracted, it lasts no more than a few hours. Severe pains can endure for days, months, and years. Indeed, pleasures in general‚Äînot just the most sublime of them‚Äîtend to be shorter-lived than pains. Chronic pain is rampant, but there is no such thing as chronic pleasure.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] &ldquo;Would you trade five minutes of the worst pain imaginable for five minutes of the greatest pleasure?&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Benatar&rsquo;s counter argument that when people are asked about their happiness that they don&rsquo;t report they&rsquo;re utterly miserable is because they&rsquo;re poor judges\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;People are very unreliable judges of the quality of their own lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] &ldquo;Most humans have accommodated to the human condition and thus fail to notice just how bad it is. Their expectations and evaluations are rooted in this unfortunate baseline. Longevity, for example, is judged relative to the longest actual human lifespans and not relative to an ideal standard. The same is true of knowledge, understanding, moral goodness, and aesthetic appreciation. Similarly, we expect recovery to take longer than injury, and thus we judge the quality of human life off that baseline, even though it is an appalling fact of life that the odds are stacked against us in this and other ways.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if people <em>are</em> in more pain the pleasure why aren&rsquo;t they killing themselves? He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;I claim that our deepest cognitive bias is ‚Äúexistence bias‚Äù, which means that we will simply do almost anything to prolong our own existence. For us, sustaining one‚Äôs existence is the default goal in almost every case of uncertainty, even if it may violate rationality constraints, simply because it is a biological imperative that has been burned into our nervous systems over millennia.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blot.blog/image/Colin-Farrell-in-Sugar.jpg\"><img class=\"wide\" src=\"https://blot.blog/image/Colin-Farrell-in-Sugar-min.jpg\"></a>  <center><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Colin Farrell in ‚ÄúSugar‚Äù</figcaption></center></p>\n<p><strong>Watched</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/civil_war_2024\">Civil War</a> - 82%.</strong> <em>Film, cinema.</em> I love the work of Alex Garland. Ex Machina, Men and Annihilation were all great. And so was this one. Wow was it intense. You need to see this in the cinema as sound is an important part. The film does have its flaws. But I&rsquo;ll skip over them because a) spoilers. And b) this was just a great experience. It&rsquo;s got some humour, action, a stance, and more tension than I&rsquo;ve experienced for a while.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/amy_2015\">Amy (2015)</a> - 79%.</strong> <em>Documentary film, <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/amy-2015\">streaming</a>. Rewatch.</em> My girlfriend is a huge Amy Winehouse fan so we decided to watch this again. Usually documentaries released so close after a persons death really are lacking. But not this one. It captures her well. The lack of talking heads, and just talking voices, works nicely and even if you&rsquo;re not a Winehouse fan this is worth a watch. As afterwards you might just be, despite how flawed she was.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scoop_2024\">Scoop</a> - 62%</strong>. <em>Film, <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/scoop-0\">streaming</a>,</em> About the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew_%26_the_Epstein_Scandal\">Prince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal</a>. It&rsquo;s okay. The makeup for Rufus Sewell playing Andrew is great. As is he. But this film very much felt like a Channel 4 TV movie and it never quite gets into top gear. And the big finale ‚Äì the interview ‚Äì needed to be longer and more tension-filled.</li>\n<li>Also, I&rsquo;m not going to review it just yet as the season isn&rsquo;t over. But I am in love with the first three episodes of <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/sugar_2024\">Sugar</a>. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/\">Colin Farrell</a> as a private detective.

(This is not the same as the publicly available version of Gemini that made headlines for refusing to create pictures of white people. That will be forgotten in a week; this will be relevant for months and years to come.)</p>\n<p>Somehow, Google figured out how to build an AI model that can comfortably accept up to¬†1 million tokens¬†with each prompt. For context, you could fit all of Eliezer Yudkowsky‚Äôs 1,967-page opus¬†<em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>¬†into¬†every message¬†you send to Gemini.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>1 million tokens is insane (tokens = words (kind of)). For context, OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-4 Turbo can accept 32,000 tokens.</p>\n<p>To be fair, these days I run into GPT-4&rsquo;s token limit rarely. My prompts aren&rsquo;t that big. But a 1 million tokens opens up a new world. The author of the article says you could send Gemini a 2,000 page book as a prompt. And I could see myself using it for that use-case. Often I remember I read something but can&rsquo;t find the passage. I could copy and paste the full book text from a .mobi file and ask Gemini for help.</p>\n<p>I think it would also be useful for my notes. They&rsquo;re all individual .md text files. But I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a tool out there that could combine them into one big file. And then I could send it to Gemini and ask questions.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p><em>blot.blog</em> is powered by <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/getting-started/\">Hugo</a>, which is static site generator. So basically my blog is a bunch of Markdown and other files that then gets &lsquo;built&rsquo; into HTML, CSS, etc. files and then uploaded to the web. But the thing is, this all has to be done manually by command in the Terminal. It&rsquo;s a pain and adds an extra layer of friction when it comes to blogging. And it also means it&rsquo;s a <em>huge</em> pain to update the blog via my phone.</p>\n<p>So I&rsquo;ve finally gotten around to automating it via a shell script to reduce this friction. Here&rsquo;s what it does:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com/\">Hazel</a> checks if there&rsquo;s a Markdown file in my drafts folder with the word <code>publish</code> in it. If so, the script is run.</li>\n<li>The script edits the &lsquo;<a href=\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/\">front matter</a>&rsquo; metadata of the post by marking it as no longer a draft and inserting the current date and time.</li>\n<li>Extracts the title from the post and renames the file as <code>YYYY-MM-DD - blog-post-title.md</code> and moves it into the non-drafts folder.</li>\n<li>Builds the blog and deploys it to Amazon S3.</li>\n<li>Does a git commit and push.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worked well so far. And as the script runs on my always-on Mac mini I can write a post on my phone and all I have to do is add <code>publish</code> to the beginning of the file name to automatically publish it.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will mean I blog a bit more often.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://blot.blog/file/build-and-deploy-blot-hugo-blog.sh\">Here&rsquo;s the code</a>, if you&rsquo;re interested)</p>\n",

Either because the laptop is an entirely fanless MacBook or a modern Windows one that has a quiet or rarely spun-up fan. It&rsquo;s all so quiet out there. No more soft hums as a computer starts to work up a sweat. No more jet engine-like screeches as it hits high load. The only noise my office features these days is the clickity clack of keyboards, the chittity chat of people and the croaky coughs of winter flu.</p>\n<p>Though there is one person still flying high the flag of the fan. And that&rsquo;s me. I have a Intel based MacBook Pro with a fan that spins up often. But I feel like a bit of a dinosaur having a fan ‚Äì it feels like coming into work with a typewriter.</p>\n<p>I knew fans were officially finished when I had two people sat next to me ask &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that noise?!&rdquo; with a confused look on their face when they heard my laptop. The sound of a fan was such a distant memory to them that they couldn&rsquo;t even <em>recognise</em> it any more.</p>\n<p>And fans should be a distance memory. A computer without a fan is quieter, cooler and simpler. But there will always be a part of me that&rsquo;s nostalgic for them. I quite like hearing them whir up as a CPU load increases. There&rsquo;s a pleasant mechanical quality to it (the constant spinning akin to the constant ticking of a mechanical watch). It&rsquo;s an audible link to how hard your computer is working. And I will miss that sound when I eventually upgrade to a modern MacBook.</p>\n",

Your neighbors should not have to pay the cost of this archaic behavior of yours.</p>\n<p>I have discovered that when I make this case, even to highly intelligent and health-conscious men and women, a psychological truth quickly becomes as visible as a pair of clenched fists: They do not want to believe any of it. Most people I meet want to live in a world in which wood smoke is harmless. Indeed, they seem committed to living in such a world, regardless of the facts. To try to convince them that burning wood is harmful‚Äîand has always been so‚Äîis somehow offensive. The ritual of burning wood is simply too comforting and too familiar to be reconsidered, its consolation so ancient and ubiquitous that it has to be benign. The alternative‚Äîburning gas over fake logs‚Äîseems a sacrilege.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Seasonality of Weight Gain</strong> (<a href=\"https://primecuts.substack.com/p/the-seasonality-of-weight-gain\">Prime Cuts Newsletter</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/98e9268f-3f1e-4e86-af3f-dbca4280efc7.html\">¬∞</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you miss the single best day of the year in stocks, your performance suffers badly over the long run&hellip; I was thinking about how the average adult in the US gains around 1-2 pounds per year&hellip; All of it (and then some) comes during the winter months.</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] I wonder what would happen to that 1-2 pound average annual weight gain per adult, if we removed three days: Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Eve.

The great journalist of working-class London, Henry Mayhew, noted in passing what he considered ‚Äòthe ordinary hours‚Äô of employment: from 06:00 to 18:00&hellip;</p>\n<p>Shifts for drivers of hackney cabs were always long: the shorter shifts lasted eleven or twelve hours, the long shifts from fourteen to sixteen hours, sometimes more. (The horses could work nothing like these hours: two or three horses were needed for a twelve-hour shift.) Even worse were the hours of many omnibus employees: frequently drivers and conductors worked twenty hours at a stretch, beginning at 4 a.m. and ending at midnight, with an hour and a half off during that time.</p>\n<p>The industry average, however, was fifteen hours: 7 a.m. to midnight, with seven minutes for dinner, and ten minutes between journeys at the termini. Shop assistants worked equally long hours. One linen draper told his fellows at the Metropolitan Drapers‚Äô Association that he had started to close his shop at 7 p.m. instead of 10 ‚Äì thus working an eleven-hour day ‚Äì and had found it saved money: ‚Äòso cheerful and assiduous‚Äô were the staff made by these short hours that he could manage with fewer employees. Henry Vizetelly, later a publisher, worked his apprenticeship as a wood-engraver, walking ten miles daily from Brixton to Judd Street in Bloomsbury and back, leaving his lodgings at about six and arriving home again around ten. And, he pointed out in his memoirs, he was lucky: City hours were longer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>For me, magazines (and newspapers too) are such a poor value in comparison to books. Today when I was in my local newsagents I noticed that a copy of the <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/\">New Scientist</a> costs ¬£7. It&rsquo;s a slim, weekly magazine. <a href=\"https://www.historyextra.com/\">BBC History Magazine</a> ‚Äì a monthly ‚Äì was ¬£6.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in science or history why not spend a little more money to get a long, detailed book instead? Something that will really help you understand and grasp the subject, rather than a 500 word cursory article.</p>\n<p>I understand that certain magazines are time sensitive and are about recent news or might not have a book equivalent. But there&rsquo;s plenty of new science books published each month on new and groundbreaking subjects. And if you&rsquo;re into history there&rsquo;s a wealth of books, new and old.</p>\n<p>Whenever I pick up a magazine the moment and notice the price I nearly always just think to myself &ldquo;I&rsquo;d gladly rather just spend double this to get a book instead that will have hundreds of times more content.&rdquo;</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Niccol√≤ Machiavelli in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince\">The Prince</a>&rdquo;</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"when-evening-has-come-i-return-to-my-house-and-go-into-my-study-at-the-door-i-take-off-my-clothes-of-the-day-covered-with-mud-and-mire-and-i-put-on-my-regal-and-courtly-garments-and-decently-reclothed-i-enter-the-ancient-courts-of-ancient-men-where-received-by-them-lovingly-i-feed-on-the-food-that-alone-is-mine-and-that-i-was-born-for-there-i-am-not-ashamed-to-speak-with-them-and-to-ask-them-the-reason-for-their-actions-and-they-in-their-humanity-reply-to-me-and-for-the-space-of-four-hours-i-feel-no-boredom-i-forget-every-pain-i-do-not-fear-poverty-death-does-not-frighten-me-i-deliver-myself-entirely-to-them\">&ldquo;When evening has come, I return to my house and go into my study.

Rewatch.</em> An inventor thinks that the painter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer\">Johannes Vermeer</a> had the help of an optical device to paint his masterpieces. He goes to extraordinary and practical lengths to prove this. It&rsquo;s shot and looks like a web documentary. But this is so great and compelling that you don&rsquo;t care.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/hellboy\">Hellboy</a> - 76%</strong>. <em>Rewatch</em>. The Nazi&rsquo;s raise a demon from the other side to help their war effort. But the twist is that the demon falls into the hands of the allies and becomes the good guy. In my mind this is a little bit like a supernatural Indiana Jones. It&rsquo;s one of my favourite comic book film adaptions. A little corny. But it&rsquo;s also a great, slightly dumb fun. I consider this a &lsquo;pizza&rsquo; movie.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/role-models\">Role Models</a> - 68%</strong>. <em>Rewatch</em>. Two screw-ups have to mentor two young kids as part of community service. This is one of my comfort films. Quietly heartwarming. And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lo_Truglio\">Joe Lo Truglio</a>&rsquo;s small role as a chap who takes LARPing a bit too seriously is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wfs2soQHFIM?t=6\">wonderful</a> (spoilers from 02:20 in).</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/avatar-2\">Avatar: The Way of Water </a>- 48%</strong>. The second Avatar film. It looks pretty, but I just didn&rsquo;t&hellip; care. Turned it off about half way in.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Listened</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Riders of the Purple Sage - 1971 - New Riders of the Purple Sage - 7/10</strong>: Decent enough, though not outstanding. A nice pretty mellow Country Rock album with a few nice songs. It grew on me as it went on.</li>\n<li><strong>New Riders of the Purple Sage - 1972 - Powerglide - 5/10</strong>: Short and sweet. There&rsquo;s some standard rock elements here, but there&rsquo;s also the expected country fare. There&rsquo;s no outstanding songs on this album, but there&rsquo;s plenty of really solid ones.</li>\n<li><strong>New Riders of the Purple Sage - 1972 - Gypsy Cowboy - 5/10</strong></li>\n<li><strong>New Riders of the Purple Sage - 1973 - The Adventures of Panama Red - 4/10</strong>: Looks like this is their most popular album. But for me this is the worst one so far. The album is less than 30 minutes long and it&rsquo;s rather dull. Fast-paced, but boring songs. <em>Lonesome L.A. Cowboy</em> is on this album which is arguably their best song, but aside from that this album isn&rsquo;t great.</li>\n<li><strong>Œº‚ÄêZiq - 2023 - 1977 - 7/10</strong>: Really loving this at the moment. It&rsquo;s an electronic &lsquo;background&rsquo; album for me, that I listen to whilst programming. It blends nicely into the background and I&rsquo;ve had on a loop for a week or two.\nh</li>\n</ul>\n",

I like my watch. It is (usually) reliable and has been a loyal friend for many years. And I must glance at it dozens of times a day. But suddenly it stopped.</p>\n<p>At first I would instinctively continue to check it, only to be reminded ‚Äì after a beat or two ‚Äì that the time it was showing was a lie.</p>\n<p>Despite all those thousands of instances down the years where I&rsquo;d loyally turned to it for the right time and it had loyally delivered, all of a sudden none of that mattered. And it took just an hour or two for the habit and the trust to break and for me to stop looking to it.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t judge it too harshly though. All watches do stop at some point. That&rsquo;s not their fault. They just need a service or a battery change every now and then. So that&rsquo;s what I did. I gave it a chance for redemption.</p>\n<p>However, problems persisted even after a service. It would stop or run slow. And the trust in it continued to erode.</p>\n<p>It did continue to be beautiful to look at throughout. But all the good looks in the world can&rsquo;t make up for it failing at its main job.</p>\n<p>I eventually binned it. You can only trust a lying watch so many times.</p>\n<p>Relationships are like this. Accumulative goodwill does build up. But only kind of; within limits. All you have to do is treat a partner badly a couple of times back-to-back for that trust to breakdown. For them to stop looking to you for the time.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t always have to be right or perfect. But you certainly can&rsquo;t be wrong or unreliable too many times in a row ‚Äì no matter how long you&rsquo;ve been reliably ticking away before that.</p>\n",

Banner Jr.</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.neh.gov_article_all-history-revisionist-history.html\">¬∞</a>)</p>\n<p>This article is a tad lifeless and an editor really needed to cut down its length. But, it&rsquo;s still likely worth your time.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t have the time? Here&rsquo;s the summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Distinct from ‚Äúthe past‚Äù are the narratives and analyses that historians offer about earlier times. That‚Äôs what we call ‚Äúhistory.‚Äù History is what people make of the forever-gone past out of surviving documents and artifacts, human recall, and such items as photographs, films, and sound recordings. And because each historian is an individual human being&hellip; they come to hold different views, have different purposes, create different interpretations, and put forth their own distinctive understandings of ‚Äúthe past.‚Äù</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] Many people find it difficult to accept such frequent challenges to what they were taught to think of as unalterably fixed and true. It‚Äôs not surprising that they ask in bewilderment: If the past can‚Äôt change, then how can the history about it do so? They‚Äôre offended to learn that at least some of what they were taught early in life as ‚Äúhistory‚Äù is no longer fully accepted by historians and is instead taught in different ways&hellip; Many people are ready to dismiss all such interpretations as no more than ‚Äúrevisionist history‚Äù‚Äîthe result of ideology, politics, and misbegotten negativism.</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] All written history is revisionist in intent or consequence. Revisionist history is a universal phenomenon. Historians‚Äô debates and shifting views of their subjects are the principal means by which they approach, while never reaching, their goal of understanding the extraordinary complexity of human life in times before their own.</p>\n<p>[&hellip;] In no case does a new way of viewing the past annihilate older ones. On the contrary: Discarded historical interpretations, like strata of ancient sedimentary rock, lie buried atop each other, out of sight until they‚Äôre made visible again for study and use. Renewed, reconsidered, and repurposed, they can then fuel fresh struggles to understand the past. Revisionist history ensures the unending renewal of knowledge of what came before our own days on earth. We should celebrate as well as accept that fact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Michael Sugrue on Marcus Aurelius and stoicism</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auuk1y4DRgk\">YouTube</a>, here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://blot.blog/audio/Marcus-Aurelius-Meditations-The-Stoic-Ideal-Auuk1y4DRgk.m4a\">audio-only copy</a>).

I just spend too much time and brain power learning words which the Oxford Dictionary label as &lsquo;<a href=\"https://public.oed.com/blog/guidance-on-labels-and-date-ranges/\">archaic</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__public.oed.com_blog_guidance-on-labels-and-date-ranges_.html\">¬∞</a>&rsquo;. Basically words not really used any more.</p>\n<p>My new strategy is only to learn new words that I&rsquo;ve already come across quite a few times or that are particularly good words.</p>\n<p>Though if I stumble upon a word that I don&rsquo;t know in a popular magazine or online article I will nearly always learn it. Because if it&rsquo;s featured in a place like that it&rsquo;s probably a fairly common word and worth learning.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Last night I saw an advert for a TV show called <em><a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/ie/online/lets-game/iYEQYZ6ymh22EfyYUHJE9Y\">Let&rsquo;s Game</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.nowtv.com_ie_online_lets-game_iYEQYZ6ymh22EfyYUHJE9Y.html\">¬∞</a></em> that&rsquo;s made by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_UK\">Sky</a>, a traditional cable provider. It&rsquo;s essentially a &lsquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Play\">let&rsquo;s play</a>&rsquo; gaming YouTube channel, only it&rsquo;s on TV (or available to stream).</p>\n<p>Sky have obviously realised this is what the kids want and watch these days (though I&rsquo;m sure quite a few executives took some convincing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a show where you watch people play video games?!&rdquo;) and have decided to offer them a more polished version of a &rsquo;let&rsquo;s play&rsquo; hoping to entice a younger audience to their services.</p>\n<p>The show is aired on the <em>Sky Kids</em> channel, so is aimed to a very young audience, with their parents being the ones actually paying the bill. But I&rsquo;m sure most young kids don&rsquo;t use Sky or even know what it is these days. When they want to watch something they go straight to YouTube or Netflix, even if their household has Sky. Sky knows this, and I&rsquo;d imagine with this show they&rsquo;re just hoping that kids <em>might</em> actually become aware of their existence and get used to their (awful, expensive) ecosystem in the hope that when the kid grows up they&rsquo;ll maybe consider a Sky subscription.</p>\n",

And there&rsquo;s a line in <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-hangover\">the Hangover</a> where Alan is asked to put some trousers on because his legs look &ldquo;weird&rdquo; and &ldquo;freaky&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>And I must think about that line weekly. It really speaks to me. Because for me nearly all legs look weird somehow.</p>\n<p>Especially mens legs. For example, how many men actually look good in shorts? A tiny amount can pull the look off. Even if they&rsquo;re good looking chaps and have nice legs most of the time wearing shorts makes them look almost chickenlike. Shorts can even transform a cool person into someone totally uncool.</p>\n<p>I notice this on screen too ‚Äì yes, the-legs-are-weird phenomenon affects movie stars too. Because not only do legs look weird, but they often move weird too.</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this: you spend half the movie watching a badass character from the waist up doing badass things. But then just for a moment or two you see a wide shot, properly showing them from the waist down for the first time, and the badass illusion is shattered. They somehow move with all the grace of an arthritic middle-aged man.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s plenty examples of this.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s the famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkskuSXqUD0\">Steven Seagal running compilation</a> <em>(though in this particular instance it&rsquo;s more his arms than his legs that make him look uncool).</em></p>\n<p>And what about Scarlett Johansson running in <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-avengers\">the Avengers</a>:<br>\n<img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/scarlett-johansson-running-in-the-avengers.gif\" alt=\"Scarlett Johansson running in the Avengers\"></p>\n<p>The most recent one I noticed was whilst watching <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/true-detective/season-1\">True Detective</a>. Matthew McConaughey has an intense conversation with Woody Harrelson where he comes across totally cool:<br>\n<a href=\"https://blot.blog/image/true-detective-S01E03.png\"><img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/true-detective-S01E03.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>But then afterwards he rather awkwardly walks off:<br>\n<img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/true-detective-walk.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For whatever reason legs do just look weird and it&rsquo;s seemingly very tough to move them in a cool way.

Ehrlich‚Äôs The Population Bomb, which contained the alarming claim: ‚ÄòThe battle to feed humanity is over. In the 1970s the world will undergo famines ‚Äî hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.‚Äô</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It now appears that out-of-control population growth is something we don&rsquo;t have to worry about too much. Nearly all countries that move from &lsquo;developing&rsquo; to &lsquo;developed&rsquo; see their birthing rate slow down and often their population actually starts to decline.</p>\n<p>So, running out of food isn&rsquo;t quite the problem we thought it would become. But what <em>are</em> the problems and side effects of an increasingly aged world?</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s the obvious things of course. Cruise ships and business&rsquo; in the health care industry will see more sales and health issues like dementia will become a bigger problem. But it might effect war too:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most wealthy countries have median ages of over 40, and middle-aged people don‚Äôt like starting fights. We have responsibilities and worries, our frontal-lobes have made us cautious, and our testosterone levels are in terminal decline.</p>\n<p>In the 1930s, when Spain erupted into war, the median age was half of what it is now. In the early 1990s the median age in Bosnia was less than 30, while today it is over 40. When Lebanon‚Äôs civil war began the average Lebanese man would have been one of six children and three brothers. Today he is one of just two siblings. That is at least partly why recent political instability and financial crisis has not led to a repeat of the war. [Author Paul Morland] cites ‚Äòstudies of decade-long periods reveal that there is almost no civil war in countries where 55 per cent or more of the population is aged over thirty.‚Äô</p>\n<p>‚ÄòWhile it cannot be said that youthfulness ‚Äúcauses‚Äù war,‚Äô he writes, ‚Äòor that maturity ‚Äúcauses‚Äù peace, a society‚Äôs age structure creates background conditions against which other things either do or don‚Äôt spark conflict.‚Äô</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And what about the Russo-Ukrainian War that&rsquo;s currently raging. How does ageing populations effect that? Well, the byline of the article is &lsquo;why Russia can‚Äôt afford to spare its young soldiers anymore&rsquo;, and the author says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the Russians turn out to have no stomach for this fight, it will probably be for the simple fact that the country does not have enough men to spare. The majority of those poor young men killed for Russia‚Äôs honour will be their mother‚Äôs only son, in many cases their only child&hellip;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right now I think Russia does have plenty of young men left to sacrifice in this pointless ‚Äì though relatively small-scale ‚Äì war with Ukraine. But they will certainly run into real issues if the war drags on (which is likely) or expands in fronts and the ferocity of its fighting. Because it&rsquo;s doubtless true that Russia can&rsquo;t afford the <em>long term</em> consequences of losing too many young men in this war.</p>\n<p>Russia has the worst of both worlds. They having an ageing population ‚Äì their birth rate is lower than it was following WWII when they lost around 40% of their adult men. <em>And</em> Russian men also die young ‚Äì 25% before the age of 55.</p>\n<p>And the life expectancy of the men who do survive this war isn&rsquo;t going to go up. They&rsquo;ll likely come back not just with physical injuries that shortens their life, but also mental ones like PTSD too. One of the big reasons Russian men die young is their <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/science/why-russian-men-dont-live-as-long.html\">over-consumption of vodka</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.nytimes.com_2014_02_18_science_why-russian-men-dont-live-as-long.html\">‚Ä†</a>. And booze related deaths will go up even higher after the war, as ex-soldiers are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5177488/\">more likely to suffer from alcoholism</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov_labs_pmc_articles_PMC5177488_.html\">‚Ä†</a>.</p>\n<p>So to summarise. Russia doesn&rsquo;t have an abundance of young men. Those they do have are currently being sent to die in a war in increasing numbers. Those that survive the war will be too injured or drunk to work. And those that can work won&rsquo;t have a job to go to due to the likely collapse of the Russian economy. Resulting in them ‚Äì like their injured colleagues ‚Äì also being more likely to die young, due to either vodka or suicide.</p>\n<p>This war in Ukraine has already caused Russia to suffer enough economic sanctions that it will take them a generation or two to financially recover. But if you add to that a protracted war that will result in a large amount of deaths of their young men ‚Äì men that aren&rsquo;t being replaced by births ‚Äì it&rsquo;s likely to result in a total catastrophe that will take Russia close to a century to recover from ‚Äì if ever.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a few other tidbits from <a href=\"https://edwest.substack.com/p/children-of-men-is-really-happening?s=r\">the article</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__edwest.substack.com_p_children-of-men-is-really-happening_s=r.html\">‚Ä†</a> I found interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In China&hellip; by 2050 there will be 150 million [people over the age of 80].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More than a quarter of major Japanese start-ups&hellip; involve care for the elderly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Europeans once expressed alarm about encroaching dominance by the world of Islam, but most Arab countries now have moderate if not low fertility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As fertility has declined, so various governments have changed their attitudes to family size. Singapore‚Äôs official advice in the 1960s was ‚ÄòStop at Two‚Äô but by 1987 it was ‚ÄòHave Three or More (if you can afford it).‚Äô</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Older people tend to vote for their own self-interests&hellip; Voters with pensions and homes opt for lower growth and restricted housebuilding, further raising the cost of home ownership for the young and so pushing down the fertility rate still further.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

The Russian&rsquo;s have done no such thing.</p>\n<p>It was always going to be hard for them to prepare for the inevitable economic war following them starting an <em>actual</em> war, when they&rsquo;re trying to convince their citizens and soldiers that a &lsquo;special military operation&rsquo; is going down, not actual said war. But the few higher-up Russian&rsquo;s who did know what was about to happen haven&rsquo;t even done the bare basics in preparation. And by the sounds of it their citizens are going to be out of everything from paracetamol to <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/billy-bookcase-white-00263850/\">IKEA Billy bookcases</a> in no time at all. And what happens then?</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve always suspected that a revolution or overthrowing of a government by citizens is very unlikely to happen in developed countries in this day of age. Placated by movies, fast food and fancy modern conveniences, people are just far too comfortable and have too much to risk to attempt a revolution ‚Äì even if their government is a nightmare.</p>\n<p>Modern life is in a way subjugating. It was probably much easier to find the motivation to get out there and join a revolution in times of old when you don&rsquo;t own a home, your child has died due to lack of medicine, you haven&rsquo;t eaten for three days, and you&rsquo;re just generally uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>But by the looks if it Russian citizens could sadly start experiencing such motivating hardships very shortly. And the question is what happens next? Will they be happy tucked up in their houses watching state propaganda television rather than Netflix, browsing government Telegram updates on their Phone rather than Twitter and YouTube and getting by on rationed food rather McDonalds and KFC? Or will their discomfort motivate them to do something drastic? Only time will tell.</p>\n",

And it isn&rsquo;t really intended for &rsquo;normal people&rsquo;, like the many construction workers in the UK who don&rsquo;t declare their income to the tax office and then use their money to buy house after house and become a land baron (a separate issue ‚Äì though one that effects me directly more than Russia money in London).</p>\n<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t really used been used anyway:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>having only been obtained nine times relating to four cases as of February 2022.

In this week&rsquo;s episode he looked at the business of porn in the post-MeToo world.</p>\n<p>One of the people he interviewed was a woman named Jen Mondello (AKA Jennifer Steele), who was raped by pornstar <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Jeremy\">Ron Jeremy</a>.</p>\n<p>When telling the story to Theroux she said that right after the assault:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;that was when the switch flipped, of&hellip; <strong>humanities just not what I think it is.</strong>&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>That</em> moment is one that too many people have to sadly go through at some point in their lives. And it causes a real shift in sensitivity. From optimism to pessimism. From mostly happy to mostly sad.</p>\n<p>Before that moment, you&rsquo;re aware of the horrors of the world. You read news stories about it and hear it second hand from others and reply &ldquo;that&rsquo;s awful&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s distant somehow. It never really connects.</p>\n<p>But then an event occurs that changes that. It could be something huge and horrific, like a sexual assault. Or a relatively smaller thing, like witnessing animal abuse.</p>\n<p>Some have <em>that</em> moment as a child. Others not until an adult. And the lucky majority never have it.</p>\n<p>But for those that do, something clicks and then breaks. A noticeable and sizeable shift happens. And from then on a sadness lingers and your perception of the world is tainted. A miasma descends and doesn&rsquo;t leave.</p>\n<p>And all of a sudden sad things aren&rsquo;t simply just sad anymore. They&rsquo;re devastating reminders of <em>that</em> moment and how everything has changed forever (and that&rsquo;s one of the biggest realisations: the permanency of the change. That things have changed for good. Innocence is lost and not returning).</p>\n<p>And going forward there&rsquo;s always that brittleness and sensitivity inside of you that has to be catered for. You might cater to it via simple steps like avoiding negative news stories and not watching depressing films. Or more involved ones such as seeing a therapist and totally changing your lifestyle. Or you might go in that other more tempting direction and take up alcohol and drugs (those substances hit different after <em>the</em> moment. They transform into an all too attractive tonic to forget and to cope).</p>\n<p>But either way, special compensation <em>has</em> to be made. Because otherwise the now evidently miserable world will engulf you entirely.</p>\n",

We need something new to revitalise the internet.</p>\n<p>So I can&rsquo;t wait to revisit web3 in a few years once things become a <em>little</em> easier and see what&rsquo;s become of it.

It&rsquo;s glaring and not subtle in any way. I don&rsquo;t know why they media have a bee in their bonnet about the couple. But they are openly bullying them. And it&rsquo;s disgusting.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t put any photos of myself onto the web for years now. This is done quite purposefully. Because there are companies out there like <a href=\"https://www.clearview.ai/\">Clearview AI</a> who scoop up hundreds of millions of images featuring peoples faces and analyse them and do creepy things. The web has gotten so bad that just putting a photo of yourself onto your Twitter feed will guarantee your privacy is invaded. I mean, by uploading a photo you&rsquo;re of course implicitly losing some privacy in the the respect that any person with an internet connection would potentially see it. But a <em>person</em>. Not a <em>machine</em>. I&rsquo;m okay with people seeing my photo and judging it. But I&rsquo;m not okay with machines seeing my photo and judging it. I&rsquo;m uncomfortable enough with the fact that Apple analyses my photo library for faces and objects. But the last thing I need is some company who offer facial recognition tools to the police to be doing the same thing.</p>\n",

It was surprisingly good.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I shocked by the weapons and armour on display. I was expecting lots of stately rooms and paintings, but the sheer amount of guns and swords took me by surprise (a very welcome surprise though).</p>\n<p>Secondly I liked how it was a &lsquo;working&rsquo; castle. It didn&rsquo;t feel like a museum. There was administrative staff knocking about, and The Queen actually spends time here ‚Äì it&rsquo;s one of her actual homes. And it was nice wondering around a room knowing that in a few days time the Queen could actually be sitting on that chair drinking a cup of tea. It gave me a closeness to her that I haven&rsquo;t experienced before.</p>\n<p>And because the Queen spends time there it&rsquo;s important that it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a museum to her. So there was a real lack of protective casing and descriptive placards, which I loved. Again, it made it feel like an actual living castle, rather that a tribute.</p>\n<p>And it was just overall very beautiful. The splendour of it all was expected, but still surprising in the flesh. Everything was intricate and stunning.</p>\n<p>Tickets cost ¬£25 per person and I would say that that&rsquo;s a fair value.

A thoughtful masterpiece.</p>\n<p>But then the <em>next</em> time I rewatched it I found it a bit slow and ponderous again, so gave up watching it about half way through after getting distracted by something else.</p>\n<p>And well right now I&rsquo;m rewatching it <em>again</em>. And it&rsquo;s flip-flopped back to being that masterpiece again. God it&rsquo;s good.</p>\n<p>And whatever you think of the it you have to appreciate it as a film, because they don&rsquo;t often make them like this anymore.</p>\n<p>It demands a decent amount from the audience ‚Äì and doesn&rsquo;t offer up details on a platter.

It&rsquo;s very &lsquo;adult&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Also, side note, I feel like you can get a good gauge of how well-made a film is by the quality of its photoshopping of photos of characters when they were meant to be younger (or ideally no photoshop at all and an actual recreation instead).

Here, Scott Alexander sums up what sounds like a curious, sprawling mess of a book.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>14:55:</strong> This morning has been one of those good ones. The caffeine  in my coffee hit <em>just</em> right and I&rsquo;ve actually had some focus. Not enough to write. Of course. Never enough focus to write. My ADHD ‚Äì or whatever I have ‚Äì won&rsquo;t allow that. But enough focus to actually sit at my desk solidly and read lots of articles, and mostly without the temptation to open up new tabs and wander elsewhere on the web &lsquo;for a break&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>Outside, Storm Eunice is raging ‚Äì yesterday we had Storm Dudley, a hilarious name for a storm. And there&rsquo;s also builders in the house right now. When there&rsquo;s workfolk inside I always turn the heating off to give them a more comfortable work environment. Partly for selfish reasons of course. If they&rsquo;re comfortable they&rsquo;ll do better work I believe, and not cut corners.</p>\n<p>But the downside of the lack of heating and the also fact that my desk is posted right next to a leaky window ‚Äì which is currently letting in 8% of Storm Eunice ‚Äì is that I&rsquo;m a tad cold. But I daren&rsquo;t relocate. The moment I get up I&rsquo;ll lose my focus and won&rsquo;t be able to get it back. I&rsquo;m even putting off going to the toilet. Though that&rsquo;s only partly to keep said focus, as it&rsquo;s mostly partly to avoid coming across said said workfolk. Reading continues. Though I should probably eat soon. Lunch is likely mackerel and rice with some peas.</p>\n<p>Damn mackerel is good. One of the few fish that I find eating isn&rsquo;t an active challenge. Like all fish though I never know quite what to pair it with, carb wise. I hate new potatoes. Rice is not my favourite thing. Pasta is okay I suppose. Tuna and pasta with a drizzle of olive oil on top is a beautifully simple and tasty dish and a staple of my summer diet. Though I vaguely remember having mackerel with pasta and find it merely okay. Anyway, today I&rsquo;m pairing it with egg fried rice (packet, of course, cooking rice scares me) and peas.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying extra hard these past few weeks to improve my diet, in the hope that it would help my M.E. And for some reason ‚Äì maybe because they&rsquo;re frozen ‚Äì in my head peas aren&rsquo;t as healthy as things like broccoli. But looking at the nutrition label the other day I realised I was wrong. Peas have an insane amount of protein and fibre in them (not sure about the vitamins). They&rsquo;re also always on hand thanks to well, being frozen. And they&rsquo;re also really easy to eat lots and lots of. And they also pair nicely with all sorts. I have them with chicken and chips, roast dinners and today, mackerel and rice. They&rsquo;re a very versatile thing. I prefer the petis pois variety myself.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>15:10:</strong> Is it lucky or unlucky to be a slow metaboliser of caffeine? Okay, actually there&rsquo;s an easy answer: unlucky. The fast folk get an instant hit and a higher high. They also can then have another cup a few hours later for a similar result and all without it effecting their sleep too much.</p>\n<p>The slow folk get a more stable, longer high, though it&rsquo;s less euphoric.  And they can also only really have one cup a day to avoid sleep issues. And it also has to be upon waking and even then it can effect their sleep negatively.</p>\n<p>Honestly though, it&rsquo;s worth figuring out if you&rsquo;re a slow metaboliser of caffeine. And you don&rsquo;t need to do a DNA test to work it out. It should be pretty obvious (though it might be complicated if you&rsquo;ve been a imbiber of caffeine everyday for years). It won&rsquo;t give an immediate and strong high, but a more gradual and lengthy one. And you&rsquo;ll also struggle to get to sleep most nights.</p>\n<p>I seriously believe that slow metabolisers having caffeine is an extremely underrated health crises that causes a lot of problems to millions of people.</p>\n<p>They have a two cups of coffee a day, so can&rsquo;t sleep and only get 6 hours of (REM disturbed) rest. When they wake up they&rsquo;re tired. So they have coffee. Rinse and repeat. After a week or so of this they&rsquo;re a wreck. But people continue this for years.</p>\n<p>I regularly take breaks from caffeine to avoid this issue. I treat caffeine like the drug it is. And I consume it with its side effects in mind. If you happen to be a slow metaboliser you should do the same. Treat it like alcohol. Just as booze messes up your sleep, so does caffeine. And it&rsquo;s not something you should be drinking every day.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/healing-power-javascript-code-programming/\">&lsquo;The Healing Power of JavaScript&rsquo; ‚Äì Craig Mod, Wired</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.wired.com_story_healing-power-javascript-code-programming_.html\">¬∞</a>.</strong></p>\n",

Among great apes, humans are the outlier. When adjusted for body mass, we burn 20% more energy per day than chimps and bonobos, 40% more than gorillas, and 60% more than orangutans, Pontzer and colleagues reported in Nature in 2016.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why? Mostly, it&rsquo;s our big brains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But humans have an added energy expense: our big brains, which account for 20% of our energy use per day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also confirms something that&rsquo;s very important to know if you&rsquo;re currently trying to lose weight. And that&rsquo;s that exercise doesn&rsquo;t really help you lose weight:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pontzer‚Äôs findings have a discouraging implication for people wanting to lose weight. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt exercise your way out of obesity,‚Äù says evolutionary physiologist John Speakman of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those zombie ideas that refuses to die.‚Äù Already the research is influencing dietary guidelines for nutrition and weight loss.

				"content_text": "<p><a href=\"https://blot.blog/image/blot-switch-to-hugo.png\"><img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/blot-switch-to-hugo.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Well, after moving <a href=\"https://blot.blog/2022/02/12/wordpress-hugo/\">my tech blog</a> to Hugo the other day I&rsquo;ve now done the same here.</p>\n<p>With blot.blog being a tumblelog/microblog type thing I wasn&rsquo;t initially planning on the switch. Firstly as good Hugo is, there is just more friction when it comes to quick posting - for the most part.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there&rsquo;s just a lot more manual inputs needed. You have to create a text file for each post, enter metadata and attatching images in some ways is more cumbersome (especially if you need multiple sizes).</p>\n<p>But the big reason I didn&rsquo;t plan on switching to Hugo is that the home page of every single Hugo blog I&rsquo;ve ever been on has only had the text preview/summary of each post and you have to click &lsquo;read more&hellip;&rsquo; or something like that to see things like images and videos. It&rsquo;s so rife that I just presumed it was a limitation of Hugo itself. But apparently not! You <em>can</em> set Hugo up to show the entirety of a post. So after I discovered that I thought maybe I could make the switch.</p>\n<p>Publishing to the blog whilst on a phone is tough - maybe even impossible on a phone. And there might be some way of doing it, but I haven&rsquo;t even bothered to look into it as it&rsquo;s so rare for me to write away from my computer that it&rsquo;s not a problem that will get in my way.</p>\n<p>And as each Hugo post is just a text file actual, <em>writing</em> is nice and easy as compared to WordPress where you had to use their fairly ugly web interface. So whilst I can&rsquo;t publish away from my computer, if want to write on my iPad or something I can just open up all my posts in my text editor of choice and away I go.</p>\n<p>Overall though I&rsquo;m pleased I switched. For now anyway.</p>\n<p>I once ran my tech blog on <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> which was a bit of disaster. I mean it worked for <em>a bit</em>. But then I think I ran into issues with <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> or something and I couldn&rsquo;t even build blog locally. Hugo seems a bit less likely to break and far more simple in comparison.</p>\n<p>The thing is though, will Hugo be around in a decade? Maybe. But WordPress certainly will. How it&rsquo;s run seems sustainable and I think it&rsquo;s so universal that it will exist in some form for <em>many</em> decades.</p>\n<p>Okay, maybe I have made a mistake switching&hellip; :|</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h3 id=\"aka-the-legally-required-my-wordpress-blog-went-down-after-making-hacker-news-post-mortem-post\">(AKA the legally required &lsquo;my WordPress blog went down after making Hacker News&rsquo; post-mortem post)</h3>\n<p>A few days ago <a href=\"https://imlefthanded.com/2022/adblocking-people-and-non-adblocking-people-experience-a-totally-different-web/\">one of my posts</a> made the front page of both <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30149800\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/sh9rsh/adblocking_people_and_nonadblocking_people/\">/r/technology</a>. It was a bit of a surprise to me. But it was an even bigger surprise to my <a href=\"https://imlefthanded.com/2021/the-5-vps/\">$5 Linode VPS</a>, which quickly collapsed under the strain.</p>\n<p>Thankfully I was home and blogging when it went down, so I noticed right away and quickly tried to diagnose why on earth PHP was using so much CPU. But the idea that it was due to a traffic influx never even crossed my mind. So I spent the first 30 minutes poking around and troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>Eventually though, I thought to myself what if it <em>was</em> due to traffic? So off I went to my <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/\">Cloudflare</a> dashboard. And sure enough, traffic!</p>\n<p>But of course once again my silly self struck again and I didn&rsquo;t think for a single moment that it was genuine, organic, human visits on my read-by-a-dozen-people blog. Nope, in my head this of course had to be a <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/\">DDoS attack</a> ‚Äì it was the only logically answer! So I turned on Cloudflare&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Under Attack&rdquo; mode and left it at that.</p>\n<p>As I sat there though, I pondered what if I was perhaps <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/\">Fireballed</a> or something? <em>(And this all had to be just pondered because at this point I had no analytics on my blog. It was good for the privacy of my twelve readers. But not so good when I was trying to work out where a load of traffic was coming from).</em> So, I went to <code>daringfireball.net</code>. But nope, I hadn&rsquo;t been linked to on there. Mmm.</p>\n<p>I then rather pathetically typed my blog into Google News, seeing if that might shine any light. But nope.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a> maybe? And&hellip; <em><strong>cook a cat!</strong></em> My latest post at the tippy top. Lots of actual humans on my blog! Panic mode engaged.</p>\n<p>And also, how do I fix my downed blog?!</p>\n<p>Well, it&rsquo;s complicated by this blog <del>being</del> used to being powered by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a>. Self-hosted WordPress blogs have a long and storied tradition of going down after making Hacker News ‚Äì a tradition my blog shamefully continued. In a world of increasingly <a href=\"https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators\">static sites</a> which survive any amount traffic, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)\">LAMP</a> based WordPress blog ‚Äì which goes down as easily as <a href=\"https://imlefthanded.com/image/fail-whale.png\">Twitter in 2008</a> ‚Äì does look a tad dinosauric and inefficient in comparison.</p>\n<p>Thankfully in the end though, fixing the problem <em>(at least temporarily)</em> was actually fairly simple thanks to the fluidity of the cloud. I just threw horsepower at the problem and simply resized my server <em>(<a href=\"https://www.linode.com/?r=5498c40b229fe04140043f777eb83c1ffa2be49b\">Linode</a> did this in just over two minutes, which I found rather impressive).</em></p>\n<p>Well, it&rsquo;s now a week or so on. And now that the dust has settled, here are some lessons and curious things I discovered after making the front page of /r/technology and Hacker News.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-much-traffic-does-rtechnology-and-hacker-news-send\">How much traffic does /r/technology and Hacker News send?</h2>\n<p>This is a little tough to know exactly as during the first hour of being on HN my blog was mostly down. But by the looks of it ‚Äì and rather surprisingly ‚Äì HN sent many more visitors than /r/technology, a subreddit with over 11 million readers <em>(though to be fair, my post made the top of HN and only sixth on reddit).</em> Here was the number of unique visitors on day one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hacker News: circa 38,000+</li>\n<li>/r/technology: 19,771</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-majority-of-traffic-is-phone-traffic\">The majority of traffic is phone traffic</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure this comes as no surprise to people who often look at the analytics of their website. But as someone who has only done so for the first time it certainly came as a surprise to me that 69% of the visitors I got were on their phone.</p>\n<p>Whenever I get the yearly itch to redesign the look of this blog I do of course always ensure it looks <em>okay</em> on a phone, but it&rsquo;s an afterthought for the most part. My priority instead is how it looks on a desktop. But apparently I&rsquo;ve got this backwards. Nowadays the focus should evidently be very much be on the smart phone, as it&rsquo;s how the majority of visitors will experience the site.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-cloudflare-worth-it\">Is Cloudflare worth it?</h2>\n<p>As the owner of a rarely visited blog, having my site run through <a href=\"http://cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare</a> felt like storing a pencil sharpener in a shipping container. So it was fun to see it actually be called into action and have proper traffic to deliver.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare did let me down in some ways. Its &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/always-online/\">Always Online</a>&rdquo; feature didn&rsquo;t save the day. It&rsquo;s supposed to show a cached copy of my blog if the server goes down. But it <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/about/always-online\">apparently</a> relies on the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive&rsquo;s</a> slow-to-crawl <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\">Wayback Machine</a> for this (<em>no hate, Internet Archive! You&rsquo;re an amazing free service and one of the best corners of the web and I love you</em>). And as <a href=\"https://imlefthanded.com/2022/adblocking-people-and-non-adblocking-people-experience-a-totally-different-web/\">the blog post</a> that made Hacker News was only a day or so old there wasn&rsquo;t a cached copy to serve. Which was a shame.</p>\n<p>But when it came to caching and serving files Cloudflare did very well, with a 95% hit rate. Of the 107 GB of bandwidth sent out, my origin server handled just 4 GB of it. CloudFlare did the rest. And I&rsquo;m sure they delivered it all far faster to the non-European visitors than my London-based Linode would have.</p>\n<p>And the thing is, I titled this section &lsquo;is Cloudflare worth it?&rsquo; But like most individuals, I&rsquo;m not on the paid plan ‚Äì just the free tier. So yes, Cloudflare is <em>very much</em> worth it. Aside from a few lock-in concerns and its tendency to present too many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA\">CAPTCHAs</a> to genuine visitors, in my mind it continues to be almost a requirement for any website to be proxied through Cloudflare. It&rsquo;s a remarkable service and tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-sort-of-server-do-you-need-for-your-wordpress-blog-to-survive-a-hacker-news-onslaught\">What sort of server do you need for your WordPress blog to survive a Hacker News onslaught?</h2>\n<p>Do you run a self-hosted <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">Wordpress blog</a> and want it to stay up and running if you make Hacker News and /r/technology? Well, it looks like a $5/mo VPS isn&rsquo;t going to be enough.</p>\n<p>My blog was hosted on a VPS with 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM when it went down. When things went south I upgraded to a $40/mo one with 4 vCPU and 8 GB RAM, which proved to be overkill ‚Äì though I did want to guarantee no more downtime.</p>\n<p>So how much compute <em>do</em> you need? Well I spent a lot of my time anxiously monitoring <a href=\"https://htop.dev/\">htop</a> throughout all this. And from the looks of it the <em>minimum</em> requirement if you want to even stand a chance of your WordPress blog surviving a Hacker News beating is 2 vCPU with 2GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>And this is presuming you have a WordPress <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/search/cache/\">caching plugin</a> installed and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">CloudFlare</a> handling the vast majority of static files. It also presumes you&rsquo;re using <a href=\"https://www.linode.com/?r=5498c40b229fe04140043f777eb83c1ffa2be49b\">Linode</a>, who have pretty high-end CPUs (AMD EPYC 7601&rsquo;s in my servers case). If you&rsquo;re using an alternative with a less beefy CPU - like <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">Digital Ocean</a> or <a href=\"https://www.vultr.com/products/cloud-compute/\">Vultr</a> - you might need more than 2 vCPU to be safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"you-should-also-harden-your-wordpress-site\">You should also harden your WordPress site</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to prepare your site for a potential influx of visitors. I know, I know, no one reads your blog. No one reads mine either. But for one day they did. And it was rather embarrassing when it immediately melted.</p>\n<p>So be over prepared. If you self-host WordPress, you need to take it a little seriously, and some steps are likely required:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install a caching plugin. There are <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/search/cache/\">many</a>. I use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a>. You don&rsquo;t stand a chance without one.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/\">Cloudflare</a>. It&rsquo;s a very useful tool. It caches static content and speeds up your blog, as well as protecting you from bots.</li>\n<li>If your blog does go down, you&rsquo;ll want to know. <a href=\"https://uptimerobot.com/\">UptimeRobot</a> can check every five minutes and email you if there are any problems - and all for free.</li>\n<li>Go overkill when it comes to hosting. I just presumed that because I wasn&rsquo;t using some over-sold shared hosting service that my blog would be able to handle a sudden influx of traffic. But I was wrong. If I was just linked to by a fairly popular blog I might have been okay. But Hacker News and reddit is a different kettle of fish, and your site will likely go down if you end up being featured there. So sadly you&rsquo;re just going to have to stump up the cash and pay the roughly $20/mo for a really good server if you want to self-host WordPress and survive a Hacker News-sized influx. That&rsquo;s just the WordPress penalty I&rsquo;m afraid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"with-all-that-being-said-bye-bye-wordpress\">With all that being said&hellip; bye-bye WordPress</h2>\n<p>After all this bother I&rsquo;ve actually decided to do the cliche thing and say goodbye to WordPress and instead go the simple, static route. This blog is now powered by <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> and hosted on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon S3</a>. And thank goodness I no longer have to worry about MySQL databases, spammy plugins or wp-login.php attacks from Ukrainian hackers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finally\">Finally</h2>\n<p>Finishing up. Overall it was really rather fun making Hacker News and /r/technology. And despite there being over 1,200 comments submitted across the two sites <em>(apparently people like talking about their hatred for ads almost as much as they like talking about their hatred for Netflix subscription price increases)</em>, basically zero were mean to me ‚Äì which was a nice surprise.</p>\n<p>Also, hello to the new people who now follow the blog! Glad to have you here. Expect two posts a year :/</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>And one final note for older readers who subscribed via RSS:</strong> the RSS feed URL is no longer <code>https://imlefthanded.com/feed/</code>. It is now <code>https://imlefthanded.com/index.xml</code>. Apologies for the annoyance, but it&rsquo;s probably best to update the URL for this blog in your feed reader of choice.

But I made the fatal mistake of having two sources of caffeine today and I can‚Äôt get to sleep.</p>\n<p>Well, it‚Äôs not even that I can‚Äôt to sleep. I haven‚Äôt even <em>attempted</em> to get to sleep. Because I can just <em>feel</em> that my brain is too caffeinated right now, so I haven‚Äôt even bothered trying.</p>\n<p>I tell you what though, caffeine is wasted on me in the morning. I mean it does it‚Äôs job. Gives me a ritual, perks me up, makes me go to the toilet - the usual suspects.</p>\n<p>But it doesn‚Äôt seem to make me much more productive really. That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm at my most productive in the middle of the night. Mornings are for <em>waking up</em>, not actually getting stuff done.</p>\n<p>So caffeine would be a really handy tool to have in those midnight hours when I get writing, reading and jobs around the house done. It would sharpen me nicely and give me a boost.</p>\n<p>But sadly I‚Äôm both very sensitive to caffeine and often find it difficult to get to sleep. So an evening coffee would be a total disaster.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I‚Äôve just started a new book (Making Darkness Light: The Lives and Times of John Milton by Joe Moshenska). And its first chapter is an introduction chapter - as you might expect.</p>\n<p>And it‚Äôs not fun to read at all. I mean, it‚Äôs a perfectly okay introduction. But few things make me want to abandon a new book than their introduction.</p>\n<p>Sometimes they are wonderful and make me ravenous to read the rest of the book. But mostly they just make me feel like I‚Äôm reading an essay.</p>\n<p>So, I plan to skip the chapter. And that‚Äôs okay. One thing I‚Äôve really started to embrace in recent years is skipping certain paragraphs, pages and chapters of books.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs freeing and useful. And I‚Äôm no longer religious about reading every single word. If it‚Äôs boring I just move on. It doesn‚Äôt mean the book is bad. Just that this bit isn‚Äôt for me.</p>\n<p>And you know what? By skipping those sections it makes me less likely to abandon the book.</p>\n<p>Try doing the same yourself (though bare in mind it‚Äôs much harder with digital books in my experience).</p>\n<p>Good night.</p>\n<p><em>Posted on my phone.

I watched it when I first came out, so this is a rewatch, but it was even more phenomenal this time around. I seriously loved it.</p>\n<p>Do I like basketball? No! But this documentary about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls had me enthralled from beginning to end.</p>\n<p>Its editing - which bounces between various periods - is a little jarring at first. But you get used to it, and it&rsquo;s actually masterful. Because by not being restrained by a chronological order allows the editor to totally manipulate the flow of the story. Which results in every single episode having spectacular moments. <em>The Last Dance</em> is ten episodes long and most definitely worth your time. It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144\">on Netlix</a>. You should watch it. <strong>9/10</strong></p>\n",

I hate westerns. But luckily this isn&rsquo;t your typical one. Firstly, it&rsquo;s shot in New Zealand which gives it a different feel and look - and there&rsquo;s some stunning scenery shots. Secondly, there&rsquo;s not a single gun fight. In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure I even saw a gun in the entire film. So no, this isn&rsquo;t your typical western. This is a story about masculinity, isolation and secrets - that happens to have a western backdrop.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a tad slow in parts - though mostly engaging throughout. But while you spend a lot of time with the characters, they all still felt quite distant to me come the end. I never really got to know them, somehow. They remained mostly just outlines to me. Though maybe that&rsquo;s the point.</p>\n<p>All in all though, this is a good film. All of the performances are subtle and beautifully pained. And I reckon it might benefit from a second viewing, and my rating may go up after that. <strong>7/10</strong> (very close to being 4/5 though)</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been dealing with <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cfs/\">M.E</a> (or chronic fatigue syndrome) for the past six months (I got it after I had a virus of some sort - possibly COVID-19 - and my body just hasn&rsquo;t been the same since). It&rsquo;s a bloody nightmare. I have very little energy and even minor tasks make me crash right after and any physical activity at all gives me muscle aches. So exercise has been totally off the cards for the last six months.</p>\n<p>So in an attempt to do <em>something</em> I thought I&rsquo;d try yoga for the first time, in the hope that it&rsquo;s gentle enough to play nicely with my M.E. I got up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLcHTdzykgk&t=1167s\">this video</a> and gave it a go.</p>\n<p>And well, it was far less gentle than I was expecting. God it&rsquo;s hard. The lady in the video looked graceful and calm in all her poses as she talked about focusing on &rsquo;tucking the navel into the spine&rsquo; and deep breathing. Whereas I was fighting for my life to just hold the pose at all.</p>\n<p>And talking of my dodgy body. I have an <a href=\"http://blot.blog/file/2022/01/Anterior-Pelvic-Tilt.jpg\">anterior pelvic tilt</a>. This tightens my hamstrings and makes any stretch which involves them difficult and a tad painful. And when I <em>do</em> stretch my hamstrings in any way my <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sciatica/\">sciatic nerve</a> plays up and for the next few days sitting down becomes uncomfortable. And by the looks of it in yoga you do quite a few poses which engage the hamstrings. So that&rsquo;s a bummer.</p>\n<p>All in all, by minute fifteen of the thirty minute video my&hellip;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glasses had fallen off.</li>\n<li>Foot had a carpet burn (I can see now why yoga-folk have those mats).</li>\n<li>Neck was hurting, as it was difficult to both do a pose and watch the video.</li>\n<li>Hamstrings were as tight as a banjo string.</li>\n<li>Arse was hurting thanks to sciatica.</li>\n<li>Hands and wrists were hurting (delicate wrists/hands are yet <em>another</em> affliction I have).</li>\n<li>M.E. was flaring up as it turns out yoga is actually quite physically demanding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I had to throw in the towel in the end. What a failure.</p>\n<p>Yoga <em>is</em> brand new to me, so I&rsquo;ll give it time and a few more goes (perhaps skipping or limiting the poses which really engage the hamstrings though). And who knows, if done with good form and more gently to accommodate my M.E., some of my body imbalances might actually improve.</p>\n",

And then it dawned on me. Video ads!</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been browsing the web with an adblocker for so long that I&rsquo;d totally forgotten about the existence of ads being spliced into video content. Ah, silly me.</p>\n<p>But just to be sure ads were the reason the website could afford to run video, I turned off my adblocker for the first time in years and visited the same page/video I was investigating. And yhep there they were. Lots of ads being regularly shown at intervals throughout the video.</p>\n<p>Also, a side effect of turning off my adblocker to check for video ads was that I was presented by general internet ads for the first time in a long time. And god was it awful. There they were, flashing and taking up large parcels of screen real estate (along with I&rsquo;m sure doing their usual tracking creepiness). What an unpleasant experience.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users\">this article</a> 27% of American internet users use an adblocker (which seems a little high to me). But either way, the 73% are experiencing a very different internet. And it&rsquo;s a far, far worse one.</p>\n<p>The internet these days has lost a lot of its charm, and I personally don&rsquo;t find it quite as fun to browse as I once did. But I think without the help of an adblocker I would find it much worse.</p>\n<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned an adblocker is a requirement. <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock\">Install one</a> if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Also, if you&rsquo;re interested, below is the post I wrote before I remembered about the existence of video advertising (a happier time).</strong></p>\n<p>One of the many plagues of the internet these days is random autoplaying videos on websites. And the <a href=\"https://condenastworldwidenews.shop/pages/magazine-list\">magazines owned by Cond√© Nast</a> are especially guilty of this.</p>\n<p>And I&rsquo;ve always wondered why they&rsquo;ve become a thing. Put to one side the annoyance to the visitor (thankfully the audio is usually on mute by default at least) and how much video streaming might cost users in countries with high data charges. But what about the cost to the website itself?</p>\n<p>I would imagine margins are pretty thin these days if you run a magazine website. Advertising revenue isn&rsquo;t what is used to be and the money they make for each visitor is probably the lowest it has ever been.</p>\n<p>So with that being the case, surely they would want to deliver each and every page as cheaply and efficiently as possible to protect those small margins? So why are they autoplaying videos, which are famously expensive to deliver?</p>\n<p>For example, lets imagine you read <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/01/on-becoming-lucy-sante\">this article</a> on Vanity Fair which <a href=\"http://instapaper.com/\">Instapaper</a> says takes 19 minutes to read. And the autoplaying video (they appear to be chosen at random) is <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/careert-timeline-priyanka-chopra-breaks-down-her-career\">this one</a> which happens to be around 19 minutes long. All of a sudden a <a href=\"https://www.webpagetest.org/result/220124_AiDcXY_aef54e5df0f3127e18fe89970c661815/\">5MB page</a> has turned into a <a href=\"https://imlefthanded.com/image/355mb-video-info.png\">261MB one</a>. (Also, the Vanity Fair / Cond√© Nast video player isn&rsquo;t very smart. Unless you make it fullscreen the video player size on the page is tiny. So it would make sense to deliver the video at 360p or a similar small resolution until the user makes the video full-screen, to save on bandwidth. But it doesn&rsquo;t. As far as I can tell, despite the player being around 200 pixels wide, the video quality quickly climbs to 1080p.)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure Cond√© Nast is a large customer for their CDN of choice and are on a pretty cheap tier with a low cost per GB delivered. But even so, again: video is expensive! And I simply can&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s worth their while to autoplay video on their site. Can anyone explain this to me?!</p>\n",

This is the most unique reality show out there right now. A man wanders around New York - and sometimes the world - with his camera and captures all sorts of weird and wonderful people and things whilst delivering a hilariously dry (though sometimes annoyingly stuttering) voice over. Season two isn&rsquo;t quite as good as the first season, but it&rsquo;s still a joyously weird visual stroll. You&rsquo;ll either love it or hate, but either way give it a go. <strong>8/10</strong> <em>(Note: sadly it&rsquo;s currently unavailable to watch in the UK legally)</em></p>\n",

Basic plot: a doctor, played by Jack O&rsquo;Connell, goes on a whaling expedition. Then stuff happens.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Jack O&rsquo;Connell as I find he often overacts, but in this he is more restrained and performs very well. However, the star of the show is a plump and menacing Colin Farrell. He is utterly terrifying and one of the best TV villains I&rsquo;ve seen in years. And he&rsquo;s actually slightly underused in the show, with his masterful performance being slightly wasted as other satellite characters take up screen time that probably should have been dedicated to him.</p>\n<p>Either way, <em>The North Water</em> is worth your time. It&rsquo;s only five episodes and probably could have done with another episode in the middle to flesh out the story and characters more. And to be honest the season does have some disjointed elements and its landing isn&rsquo;t quite as good as its takeoff, but again it is still worth a watch. Also, be aware that in my view the first episode is perhaps its weakest one in the season so if it doesn&rsquo;t grab you right away at least give episode two a go before jumping ship. <strong>7/10</strong></p>\n<p>(Also, if you enjoy it be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-terror/season-1\"><em>The Terror</em> (Season 1)</a>, as it has similar vibes and is also the superior of the two shows.)</p>\n",

He asked for total creative control, 20 percent of first-dollar gross, and a blackout period from the studio wherein the company would not release another movie three weeks before or three weeks after his release. And he asked for what insiders say was around a 100-day theatrical window. (Some sources have said the number was 110 days, with one person saying it was 130 days.) These were, in fact, many of the conditions Nolan was accustomed to enjoying at Warners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>&rsquo; <em>Battlefield 2042</em> joins recent game-delay frenzy, moves to November&rsquo;.</strong> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/battlefield-2042-joins-recent-game-delay-frenzy-moves-to-november/\">Ars Technica</a> [<a href=\"https://elt.s3.amazonaws.com/file/arstechnica.com/_gaming_2021_09_battlefield-2042-joins-recent-game-delay-frenzy-moves-to-november_.html\">c</a>].

Rich people still pay their National Insurance. So if they&rsquo;re willing to go private it means the NHS has less of a workload and will work better for those who can&rsquo;t afford to go private. However, apparently not so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúBy and large, private hospitals in the UK don‚Äôt have a fully separate workforce from the NHS,&hellip; [they] don‚Äôt tend to directly employ a separate set of doctors. They are [mostly] NHS doctors spending part of their time in private practice to supplement their income.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúStaff [numbers] are going to be a critical constraint on the NHS being able to treat more patients and get rid of this backlog. If they are spending more time practising in the private sector that might be taking away time from the NHS, which may have an impact on people who can‚Äôt afford to go private,‚Äù Mr Gardner added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
