The day features a spectacular parade of giant puppets through the city center, reenacting the story of Alban, Britain&rsquo;s first Christian martyr. The event includes Roman centurions, chariots, and lions, creating an atmosphere of ancient times. Following the procession, there will be family-friendly activities, live music, craft stalls, and historical reenactors throughout the city. The celebration also coincides with Windrush Day, adding Caribbean music and food to the festivities.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>Like a lot of bloggers I have a small, but <em>quiet</em> audience. So I&rsquo;m a fan of using analytics to see who&rsquo;s visiting my site. It&rsquo;s a delight to discover the various corners of the globe that have stumbled upon my writings.</p>\n<p>However, most analytics tools don&rsquo;t cater to this niche market. Google Analytics (GA) is the behemoth of tracking – it&rsquo;s free but overkill, privacy-invading, and has a confusing web interface. Other choices are limited and often expensive, charging £10-£20/month, which isn&rsquo;t justifiable for many small bloggers like myself.</p>\n<p>As a result I simply haven&rsquo;t used or cared about analytics for many years. The last time I regularly used one was when <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130327075313/http://www.haveamint.com/\">Mint</a> was <a href=\"https://initialcharge.net/2016/12/goodbye-mint-fever/\">still alive</a>.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I was thrilled to discover <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">Tinylytics</a>. Their free plan offers 1,000 page hits/month, which is perfect for many bloggers. And if you need more, their paid plan is a very reasonable $5/month – a price I&rsquo;d gladly pay.</p>\n<p>And one of the best features is that you can track up to 5 sites on the free plan and unlimited sites on the paid plan. As a web tinkerer with multiple small sites, this is a game-changer for me.</p>\n<p>Also I love the page that explains <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/why-a-free-plan\">why they offer a free plan</a>, as it pretty much sums up what I&rsquo;ve been saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A lot of analytics software is too expensive. Period. Heck, I just started a small side project or a personal site and I don&rsquo;t want to shell out $9 - $14 per month just for analytics that looks pretty.<br>\n[&hellip;]<br>\nThere are free options from big providers, but guess what&hellip; they&rsquo;re probably using your data to better meet their own needs and most likely advertisers.<br>\n[&hellip;]<br>\nHaving a free plan, from someone that deeply cares, and from an individual, not a huge corporate or venture funded company, is the best start you can give yourself without worrying what will happen with your data. It sits on my server, and is backed up hourly to an offsite encrypted backup. That&rsquo;s it. Oh and you won&rsquo;t break the bank either. I think that&rsquo;s a win win.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a small blogger looking for an affordable, privacy-focused, and user-friendly analytics solution, I highly recommend giving <a href=\"https://tinylytics.app/\">Tinylytics</a> a try.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://imlefthanded.com/image/tinylytics-min.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",

I thought this passage on Virginia Woolf’s depression treatment interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf\">Virginia Woolf</a>, on the other hand, was in the 1920s treated, if that is the right word, by the then recommended regime of complete rest – not even books were allowed, lest they excite the brain – milk, weight gain, fresh air and early nights. One of her doctors, Sir George Savage, was especially keen to treat neurasthenic women by excessive feeding and complete rest. Woolf was given four or five pints of milk every day, half a pint every two hours. After five days of milk on this scale, she was allowed to add a cutlet, malt extract, cod liver oil and beef tea. The rather brainless thinking behind the regime was that since patients like Woolf stopped eating and lost weight when depressed, they could be forced back into wellness by being made to gain weight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Imagine having depression and your ‘treatment’ is being forced to do nothing and drink loads of milk.</p>\n<p>Side note. I like this picture of her. She looks so very <em>human</em>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blot.blog/image/virginia-woolf.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/virginia-woolf-min.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n",

And after a sad, brief mention of a woman named Annie Weaving <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1248066/In-search-Arcadia-In-Hungry-1930s-mothers-starved-death-feed-children.html\">who died aged 37</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.dailymail.co.uk_femail_article-1248066_In-search-Arcadia-In-Hungry-1930s-mothers-starved-death-feed-children.html.html\">°</a> potentially due to not being able to feed both herself and her family there’s a reference to something called “protective foods”.</p>\n<p>I’d never heard the term. I thought they might be “protected” as in having their price controlled by the government. But it’s actually the precursor to the food pyramid idea.</p>\n<p>One poster I found promoting it suggests this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PINT MILK, 1 EGG, 1 POTATO AND TWO OTHER VEGETABLES (ONE OF THESE A GREEN LEAFY ONE), 2 SERVINGS OF FRUIT (AT LEAST ONE RAW), 1 SERVING OF MEAT OR FISH, 1 OZ. BUTTER.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I think it still holds up. Could it be improved? Probably. But it’s simple and realistic. I like it.</p>\n<p>People often overthink diet. So I like simplicity. It reminds me of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan\">Michael Pollan&rsquo;s</a> mantra:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some info on the history of the food pyramid <a href=\"https://www.swspotlight.com/articles/spotlight-news/the-evolution-of-the-food-pyramid/\">here</a><a href=\"https://blot.blog/cached/https__www.swspotlight.com_articles_spotlight-news_the-evolution-of-the-food-pyramid_.html\">°</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blot.blog/image/protective-foods.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n",
