I am always too aware of my audience when I write. To the point that anything too short or off topic feels like I'm wasting their time. As a result I have created way too many blogs down the years (and I still maintain too many).\r\n\r\nSo I've found my recent discovery of Micro.blog very freeing. I don't care too much on here. I just share what's on my mind. No matter how short, long or off topic.\n",
