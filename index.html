			 <p>I rarely think about how I’m lucky to live in a warm house with running water, have access to the internet, the freedom of a car, or that I’ve outlived plenty of my ancestors. I barely notice any of it – to my shame.</p>

<p>When I saw this in the cinema upon release I thought it was a fairly flawed follow-up to <em>The Dark Knight (2008)</em>. It was a very good film. But it was a bit long and had a villain whose motives were more vague and less believable than the Joker&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>My experience wasn&rsquo;t helped by seeing it in IMAX and being unable to hear the dialogue for most of the film (there wasn’t a problem, it’s just how Christopher Nolan likes his audio. Which is insane. And it’s the reason I don’t see new Nolan films in the cinema anymore).</p>
<p>Since then though it’s become one of my rewatched staples, and I’ve seen it another 6-8 times. Though my feelings for it remained the same. That it was great, but rather flawed and lagged in parts.</p>
<p>But I’ve just gotten back from seeing it in the cinema again. And I’ve walked away with an increased opinion of it. Firstly, it wasn’t in IMAX, so I could hear basically every word.</p>
<p>But more than that it was just wonderful seeing a proper high-quality blockbuster in the cinema. The cinematography, soundtrack, sound design, and action were great to see on the big screen. Aside from <em>Civil War (2024)</em>, I haven’t had a cinema experience come close to it for quite a few years. Sure, there&rsquo;s some cringy moments – especially from Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s Catwoman. And it remains a flawed film. But it’s still a Nolan film, so it’s many times better than nearly all the dross that I see these days.</p>
<p><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is still a wonderful film to sit back and experience. <strong>83%</strong></p>

			 <p>I now fall asleep every time I go to the cinema. I regularly struggle to sleep at night in my comfy bed in total silence. So why do I find sleeping in the middle of day at the loud cinema totally irresistible? It’s actually becoming annoying now. I want to actually watch the film, not sleep!</p>

			 <p>I’m 32. So hopefully death is still many decades away. But I still really need to document how I want my family to handle my digital legacy. Especially my websites. I don’t care if my personal files on my Mac disappear. But I’d like my websites to remain online for as long as possible after I die.</p>
<p>Right now I have three sites powered by Hugo and hosted on AWS. They should remain up for a decade or two as long as the $5/mo bill is paid. My biggest concern would be AWS introducing a new login or payment system that requires manually migrating to. A non-techy family member might struggle with that.</p>
<p>I also have my Micro.blog blog. As of today it doesn’t hate enough posts for me to be upset at the prospect of it disappearing. But if I did want to preserve it my main concern would be that Micro.blog could very easily be shut down. Luckily it’s all static pages and is Hugo again behind the scenes, so it shouldn’t be too tricky for a somewhat tech savvy friend/family member to get a copy of it all onto AWS.</p>
<p>My main concern are my Obsidian notes that get turnt into Learnt.me. In many ways that site is the most in-depth digital representation of who I am, so I’d like it to survive after I died. It’s turned into a website via Obsidian’s ‘Publish’ feature. But the site seems very JavaScript-y and not the easiest to have backups of. Luckily all the notes that the site are based on are just Markdown notes. And there’s also at least one other service that offers something like Obsidian Publish. But either way, worse case scenario all my notes could just be uploaded to an Apache web server and be browsed and viewed via the folder hierarchy. However I really like how Learnt.me looks and works. It would be a shame to lose that.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the best solution is long term. I thought about having all the content hosted on NearlyFreeSpeech. It’s pay as you go, so I could deposit a bunch of money into it. But to be honest, as long as I can find a way for the AWS bill to be paid, that would be the easiest and most reliable route for long term hosting.</p>
<p>But either way, my digital ‘estate’ is in a much more stable long term state than it has been in the past. Sure, I have too many sites, which makes things more tricky. But at least none are powered by WordPress, which would make things very brittle and tough to keep up and running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Air&rdquo; is about the creation of Air Jordan shoes at Nike. It&rsquo;s silly and corny, but very enjoyable.</p>
<p>Moving along at a quick, fun pace and feels a bit like an <a href="https://letterboxd.com/director/adam-mckay/">Adam McKay</a> film at times.</p>
<p>This is also quite the &lsquo;Dad film&rsquo; (another one for Matt Damon, after <a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/ford-v-ferrari">Ford v Ferrari</a>).</p>
<p>You might have missed &ldquo;Air&rdquo;. But you should correct that, as it&rsquo;s a great way to spend 111 minutes and very much worth a watch. It&rsquo;s hard to dislike it.</p>
<p>Also: are you ever unsatisfied by the &ldquo;where are they now&rdquo; segment at the end of &ldquo;based on a true story&rdquo; film, when they don&rsquo;t go into enough detail? Well this delivers in this department.</p>
<p>After &ldquo;Air&rdquo; you should watch:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-last-dance">The Last Dance</a>, a documentary about Michael Jordan.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/blackberry">BlackBerry</a>, another &lsquo;business film&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s another solid film you might have missed..</li>
</ul>

The only difference being you use your Lenovo ID to sign in to Dropbox (don&rsquo;t use an email address you&rsquo;ve already used with Dropbox).</p>
<p>These are the plans offered:</p>

			 <p>I recently saw the poet <a href="https://www.harrybaker.co/">Harry Baker</a>. My girlfriend was the fan and wanted to go, though I had also enjoyed what little I had seen of him.</p>
<p>It was at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/r5KnmuNf4y2o2jnn7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy">Saint Saviours Church Hall, St Albans</a>, which is the hippest church I&rsquo;ve been to. There was kegs of beer, fairy lights and some sofas to the side of the nave. And the vicar had a shaved head, tattoos and wore cargo shorts.</p>
<p>I was a huge poetry nerd in my tormented teen years (14-17). But these days I don&rsquo;t have much interest – and certainly not in modern poetry. So I wasn&rsquo;t massively looking forward to a night of non-stop poems.</p>
<p>But the show was great. His poetry is perfect for the modern era. Funny, witty and with a great musicality. The way his voice delivers lines is wonderful. There&rsquo;s an earnestness to the way he speaks that is enrapturing.</p>
<p>And he didn&rsquo;t overstay his welcome. I was worried it would be 2 hours+ of non-stop poetry. But it was just the right length, with a break in between where you could buy a book and meet him.</p>
<p>When my girlfriend met him she decided to go down the more casual route. Rather than a &ldquo;huge fan of your work, you&rsquo;re my hero&rdquo;, she went with a simple &ldquo;hello, how are you?&rdquo;. He didn&rsquo;t appear to be expecting such an unassuming greeting and it led to 45 seconds of incredibly uncomfortable awkwardness. The stilted back-and-forth continued painfully as she hurriedly chose a book and he hurriedly got out the card reader. I couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://clowes.blog/2024/07/03/blogging-like-dave.html">Blogging like Dave Winer: the case for making more of your thoughts public</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://clowes.blog/2024/07/03/blogging-like-dave.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-07-03 03:16:19 &#43;0100">Jul 3, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Winer">Dave Winer</a> has been <a href="http://scripting.com">blogging since 1994</a>. And extensively too. His output is remarkable. And the result of that is nearly everything that he references and talks about from the past has a blog post he can link to. You can see his thinking in real time and get a great deal of context.</p>
<p>And it makes me want to both blog more freely and frequently and also live life more publicly online. And I think that there&rsquo;s good arguments to be made for writing publicly on a weblog, rather than in offline software.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used the journaling app <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> for years. It&rsquo;s been around for a while and now that it&rsquo;s owned by <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> I expect it will continue to be around for many years.</p>
<p>But generally speaking, software is more brittle than the web. It often uses proprietary formats and is prone to abandonment. Whereas the web is more open, easier to back up and won&rsquo;t go away any time soon. In 50 years time I&rsquo;d be shocked if a HTML/CSS webpage can&rsquo;t still be shown the average computer still. I doubt Day One will still be around.</p>
<p>And in my 20 years of writing and journaling I&rsquo;ve used many different software. The end result of that is my writing is all over the place, in different formats and different apps.</p>
<p>So what if that whole time I just used something like WordPress instead? Today my thoughts would all be in one place, nicely tagged<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, easily searchable and with a URL that I could link to.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the tricky subject of death. If I die today no one is accessing my journal. A journal that might be interesting to my family. But if my thoughts were on a blog they could see them easily.</p>
<p>Of course there&rsquo;s privacy concerns with the web. WordPress does let you make posts private or hidden behind a password. But data breaches can happen and things can leak. So that is a downside.</p>
<p>But my whole point is that I want more of my thoughts and life to be <strong>public</strong>. If I&rsquo;m honest I&rsquo;m not one of those people who pours my heart out in my journal anyway.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> So 90% of what I write I&rsquo;d happily make public and that&rsquo;s my aim.</p>
<p>With clowes.blog I&rsquo;m attempting to live a bit more publicly. But it still doesn&rsquo;t come close to what Dave Winer&rsquo;s scripting.com does. For me to get there I need to share and write more frequently.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to try it. I think future me will be glad I did.</p>

<p>I did my best to transfer my data from one service to another down the years. But one of the things that was always hardest to keep in the transfer were things like tags. If I used WordPress I would have had the same tag system from the start.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the things I like least about my journaling style. I am always thinking of an audience when I journal. I know that no one other than me is going to read it, but yet I still can&rsquo;t open up and share exactly what I&rsquo;m feeling.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Imagine a world where being single isn&rsquo;t just frowned upon—it&rsquo;s outlawed. That&rsquo;s the premise of The Lobster. In this dystopian society adults have 45 days to find a romantic partner. Fail, and you&rsquo;re transformed into an animal of your choice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an odd premise and an odd film. When I saw it in the cinema first time around, I loved it. I hadn&rsquo;t seen <a href="https://letterboxd.com/director/yorgos-lanthimos/">Yorgos Lanthimos</a>' work before, so I was surprised and delighted by its weirdness (and he&rsquo;s now one of my favourite directors).</p>
<p>Its genuinely funny in its absurdity and I love it. It could perhaps have 15 minutes cut from it and its ending isn&rsquo;t quite strong enough. But this a odd and wonderful film. You&rsquo;ll probably either love it or hate it.</p>

<p>This always looked terrible. And the trailer was so bad it became a literal meme. However, this evening I was looking for an easy watch and saw that the reviews are surpassingly high. So I thought I&rsquo;d give it a go.</p>
<p>Firstly, this is largely a musical. And despite a catchy chorus here and there it&rsquo;s not especially special. The film is also not really about chocolate and sweets, which I found a bit disappointing. I wanted to see towers of sugar as far as the eye can see. But Wonka as chocolatier could have been removed and it wouldn&rsquo;t have changed much.</p>
<p>This is directed by Paul King, who did the Paddington&rsquo;s, and you can tell. They both have a visual charm that I really like. The comedic style is similar too. And it shares a lot of the same actors</p>
<p>However, Wonka ain&rsquo;t Paddington. Paddington is fun for the whole family. Whereas I&rsquo;d argue Wonka will be highly enjoyable for the kids, but there&rsquo;s not enough here for the adults.</p>
<p>The film is rather sweet and watchable. But it just feels weirdly lifeless. I won&rsquo;t be running back to rewatch it.</p>

Originally a Celtic settlement known as Verlamion, it was later conquered by the Romans and renamed Verulamium. The city is named after St Alban, Britain&rsquo;s first Christian martyr, who was executed there in the 3rd or 4th century. St Albans played a significant role in English history, including being the site of two battles during the Wars of the Roses and the drafting of the Magna Carta. Today, it boasts numerous historical sites such as the St Albans Cathedral, Roman ruins, and the medieval Clock Tower, making it a popular destination for visitors interested in its rich heritage and vibrant culture.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The whole Wall Street vs. the working person story felt forced at times and it didn’t lead to a satisfying conclusion in the final act.</p>
<p>The ‘dumb’ bad guys were comically dumb. And the ‘scary’ bad guys weren’t scary enough.</p>
<p>However, the reviews for this are fairly strong and my girlfriend enjoyed it, so I’m in a minority.</p>
<p>And this <em>was</em> weirdly watchable and fun. And I always enjoy seeing Paul Dano on screen. He always brings the human to his roles, and this one is no different. <strong>58%</strong></p>

			 <p>🔗 <strong><a href="https://colly.com/articles/stream-on">Stream on</a></strong></p>
<p>Simon Collison has written about having a longer form blog and also a short one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A primary motivation for creating my Stream was the paralysing sense that a blog post needed appropriate length and weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that feeling well. I am always too aware of my audience when I write. To the point that anything too short or off topic feels like I&rsquo;m wasting their time. As a result I have created way too many blogs down the years (and I still maintain too many).</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve found my recent discovery of Micro.blog very freeing. I don&rsquo;t care too much on here. I just share what&rsquo;s on my mind. No matter how short, long or off topic.</p>

			 <p><strong><a href="https://people.com/dad-wears-same-ll-bean-shirt-for-over-30-years-exclusive-8646111">Daughter Realizes Dad Has Worn Same L.L.Bean Flannel Shirt Since 1988</a></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a recent convert to flannel. Like pickup trucks they do just look a bit silly in the UK. But the benefits outweigh that for me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so versatile. Lovely and warm in the autumn, often letting you go out without a jacket. And you can wear a t-shirt underneath and then unbutton the shirt if you get too hot. And in the winter they&rsquo;re often thick enough that when paired with a jacket you are nice and toasty.</p>
<p>Flannel is also hardy and long lasting (though not as hardy as they once were I&rsquo;m sure). I drunkenly fell off my bicycle last year wearing an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch one. It has a few scuffs, but it survived very well indeed. And if I wasn’t wearing it my skin would have been <em>covered</em> in road rash.</p>
<p>Another reason I like this story is because it reminds me of the ‘capsule wardrobe’. The idea that you have a default outfit – or a few default outfits. Meaning you don&rsquo;t spend a bunch of time working out what to wear each day.</p>
<p>I have too many clothes to have a &lsquo;capsule&rsquo;. But I would say I have a &lsquo;uniform&rsquo; at work. I wear the same Cos fleece, Charles Twyitt trousers and Clark’s dessert boots each day.</p>

			 <p>At least once a week I think about what&rsquo;s going to happen to my websites once I die. Within a month or two they&rsquo;ll probably disappear, which upsets me.</p>
<p>What can I do to avoid that? It shouldn&rsquo;t be <em>too</em> difficult. All my sites are static, aside from <a href="https://learnt.me">Learnt.me</a> which is put online via <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian Publish</a>. But Learnt.me is probably the site I&rsquo;d like to remain online the most after I die.</p>
<p>WordPress now offers their <a href="https://wordpress.com/100-year/">100-Year Plan</a>. But it&rsquo;s $38,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> is pay-as-you-go. So I could conceivably top up my account with as much as I could afford and it should last a while (assuming they stay in business).</p>
<p>My current sites are largely on Amazon S3. So as long as there&rsquo;s an active card to pay the $3-4 monthly pay it should keep working for many years.</p>
<p>But ideally my Will gives some instructions and some money for preserving my digital legacy. And one of my more tech-y friends could carry it out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan on dying any time soon. But it would be good to put a plan in place.</p>

<p>I love discovering a wonderful new homepage or blog. Especially on the weekend when I have time to gently sip away at its content. This time it’s <em>Arun</em> and their website arun.is.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-a-h3">This is a H3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest changes in my personality with middle age is that I no longer really enjoy travel beyond local weekend getaways. Almost no destination has a pain/novelty ratio that makes it worth it… Even though travel has gotten way more convenient overall (smartphones, eSIM cards, cashless payments, Uber, Google Translate — though at the expense of phone-loss anxiety), my tolerance for discomfort has plummeted. I don’t like shitty hotels/hostels, awkward couchsurfing, wrangling luggage, driving unfamiliar cars, figuring out transit systems… I especially don’t like wading through lots of options figuring out food options. The net effect is that I’ve gradually gone sessile.</p>
