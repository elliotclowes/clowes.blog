<p><strong><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/in-one-paragraph-5rFGGPmaSYiO2uvu_8gpDQ">Perplexity</a> summary of St. Albans</strong>: St Albans is a historic cathedral city in Hertfordshire, England, located about 20 miles northwest of London. Originally a Celtic settlement known as Verlamion, it was later conquered by the Romans and renamed Verulamium. The city is named after St Alban, Britain&rsquo;s first Christian martyr, who was executed there in the 3rd or 4th century. St Albans played a significant role in English history, including being the site of two battles during the Wars of the Roses and the drafting of the Magna Carta. Today, it boasts numerous historical sites such as the St Albans Cathedral, Roman ruins, and the medieval Clock Tower, making it a popular destination for visitors interested in its rich heritage and vibrant culture.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Adequately put together and fairly fun, but this was merely okay.</p>
<p>The whole Wall Street vs. the working person story felt forced at times and it didn’t lead to a satisfying conclusion in the final act.</p>
<p>The ‘dumb’ bad guys were comically dumb. And the ‘scary’ bad guys weren’t scary enough.</p>
<p>However, the reviews for this are fairly strong and my girlfriend enjoyed it, so I’m in a minority.</p>
<p>And this <em>was</em> weirdly watchable and fun. And I always enjoy seeing Paul Dano on screen. He always brings the human to his roles, and this one is no different. <strong>58%</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d never really thought about that. Search is difficult. I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with the search function of nearly all software I use.</p>

<p>A primary motivation for creating my Stream was the paralysing sense that a blog post needed appropriate length and weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that feeling well. I am always too aware of my audience when I write. To the point that anything too short or off topic feels like I&rsquo;m wasting their time. As a result I have created way too many blogs down the years (and I still maintain too many).</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve found my recent discovery of Micro.blog very freeing. I don&rsquo;t care too much on here. I just share what&rsquo;s on my mind. No matter how short, long or off topic.</p>

			 <p><strong><a href="https://people.com/dad-wears-same-ll-bean-shirt-for-over-30-years-exclusive-8646111">Daughter Realizes Dad Has Worn Same L.L.Bean Flannel Shirt Since 1988</a></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a recent convert to flannel. Like pickup trucks they do just look a bit silly in the UK. But the benefits outweigh that for me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so versatile. Lovely and warm in the autumn, often letting you go out without a jacket. And you can wear a t-shirt underneath and then unbutton the shirt if you get too hot. And in the winter they&rsquo;re often thick enough that when paired with a jacket you are nice and toasty.</p>
<p>Flannel is also hardy and long lasting (though not as hardy as they once were I&rsquo;m sure). I drunkenly fell off my bicycle last year wearing an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch one. It has a few scuffs, but it survived very well indeed. And if I wasn’t wearing it my skin would have been <em>covered</em> in road rash.</p>
<p>Another reason I like this story is because it reminds me of the ‘capsule wardrobe’. The idea that you have a default outfit – or a few default outfits. Meaning you don&rsquo;t spend a bunch of time working out what to wear each day.</p>
<p>I have too many clothes to have a &lsquo;capsule&rsquo;. But I would say I have a &lsquo;uniform&rsquo; at work. I wear the same Cos fleece, Charles Twyitt trousers and Clark’s dessert boots each day.</p>

			 <p>At least once a week I think about what&rsquo;s going to happen to my websites once I die. Within a month or two they&rsquo;ll probably disappear, which upsets me.</p>
<p>What can I do to avoid that? It shouldn&rsquo;t be <em>too</em> difficult. All my sites are static, aside from <a href="https://learnt.me">Learnt.me</a> which is put online via <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian Publish</a>. But Learnt.me is probably the site I&rsquo;d like to remain online the most after I die.</p>
<p>WordPress now offers their <a href="https://wordpress.com/100-year/">100-Year Plan</a>. But it&rsquo;s $38,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> is pay-as-you-go. So I could conceivably top up my account with as much as I could afford and it should last a while (assuming they stay in business).</p>
<p>My current sites are largely on Amazon S3. So as long as there&rsquo;s an active card to pay the $3-4 monthly pay it should keep working for many years.</p>
<p>But ideally my Will gives some instructions and some money for preserving my digital legacy. And one of my more tech-y friends could carry it out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan on dying any time soon. But it would be good to put a plan in place.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes in my personality with middle age is that I no longer really enjoy travel beyond local weekend getaways. Almost no destination has a pain/novelty ratio that makes it worth it… Even though travel has gotten way more convenient overall (smartphones, eSIM cards, cashless payments, Uber, Google Translate — though at the expense of phone-loss anxiety), my tolerance for discomfort has plummeted. I don’t like shitty hotels/hostels, awkward couchsurfing, wrangling luggage, driving unfamiliar cars, figuring out transit systems… I especially don’t like wading through lots of options figuring out food options. The net effect is that I’ve gradually gone sessile.</p>
