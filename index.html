<p>There’s also Gaucho Tower Bridge next door, which is a bit more upmarket. No idea what their food is like. But the outdoor seats would give you fantastic views on a romantic dinner date.</p>

<p>Don’t use a post just to link to something elsewhere. If there’s a point to make, start with that.</p>

<p>Adequately put together and fairly fun, but this was merely okay.</p>
<p>The whole Wall Street vs. the working person story felt forced at times and it didn’t lead to a satisfying conclusion in the final act.</p>
<p>The ‘dumb’ bad guys were comically dumb. And the ‘scary’ bad guys weren’t scary enough.</p>
<p>However, the reviews for this are fairly strong and my girlfriend enjoyed it, so I’m in a minority.</p>
<p>And this <em>was</em> weirdly watchable and fun. And I always enjoy seeing Paul Dano on screen. He always brings the human to his roles, and this one is no different. <strong>58%</strong></p>

<p>He says that one of the benefits of sharing your thoughts or solutions on your blog is that they&rsquo;re very easy to find again thanks to search engines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never really thought about that. Search is difficult. I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with the search function of nearly all software I use.</p>

<p>A primary motivation for creating my Stream was the paralysing sense that a blog post needed appropriate length and weight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that feeling well. I am always too aware of my audience when I write. To the point that anything too short or off topic feels like I&rsquo;m wasting their time. As a result I have created way too many blogs down the years (and I still maintain too many).</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve found my recent discovery of Micro.blog very freeing. I don&rsquo;t care too much on here. I just share what&rsquo;s on my mind. No matter how short, long or off topic.</p>

			 <p><strong><a href="https://people.com/dad-wears-same-ll-bean-shirt-for-over-30-years-exclusive-8646111">Daughter Realizes Dad Has Worn Same L.L.Bean Flannel Shirt Since 1988</a></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a recent convert to flannel. Like pickup trucks they do just look a bit silly in the UK. But the benefits outweigh that for me.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so versatile. Lovely and warm in the autumn, often letting you go out without a jacket. And you can wear a t-shirt underneath and then unbutton the shirt if you get too hot. And in the winter they&rsquo;re often thick enough that when paired with a jacket you are nice and toasty.</p>
<p>Flannel is also hardy and long lasting (though not as hardy as they once were I&rsquo;m sure). I drunkenly fell off my bicycle last year wearing an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch one. It has a few scuffs, but it survived very well indeed. And if I wasn’t wearing it my skin would have been <em>covered</em> in road rash.</p>
<p>Another reason I like this story is because it reminds me of the ‘capsule wardrobe’. The idea that you have a default outfit – or a few default outfits. Meaning you don&rsquo;t spend a bunch of time working out what to wear each day.</p>
<p>I have too many clothes to have a &lsquo;capsule&rsquo;. But I would say I have a &lsquo;uniform&rsquo; at work. I wear the same Cos fleece, Charles Twyitt trousers and Clark’s dessert boots each day.</p>

			 <p>At least once a week I think about what&rsquo;s going to happen to my websites once I die. Within a month or two they&rsquo;ll probably disappear, which upsets me.</p>
<p>What can I do to avoid that? It shouldn&rsquo;t be <em>too</em> difficult. All my sites are static, aside from <a href="https://learnt.me">Learnt.me</a> which is put online via <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Obsidian Publish</a>. But Learnt.me is probably the site I&rsquo;d like to remain online the most after I die.</p>
<p>WordPress now offers their <a href="https://wordpress.com/100-year/">100-Year Plan</a>. But it&rsquo;s $38,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> is pay-as-you-go. So I could conceivably top up my account with as much as I could afford and it should last a while (assuming they stay in business).</p>
<p>My current sites are largely on Amazon S3. So as long as there&rsquo;s an active card to pay the $3-4 monthly pay it should keep working for many years.</p>
<p>But ideally my Will gives some instructions and some money for preserving my digital legacy. And one of my more tech-y friends could carry it out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan on dying any time soon. But it would be good to put a plan in place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest changes in my personality with middle age is that I no longer really enjoy travel beyond local weekend getaways. Almost no destination has a pain/novelty ratio that makes it worth it… Even though travel has gotten way more convenient overall (smartphones, eSIM cards, cashless payments, Uber, Google Translate — though at the expense of phone-loss anxiety), my tolerance for discomfort has plummeted. I don’t like shitty hotels/hostels, awkward couchsurfing, wrangling luggage, driving unfamiliar cars, figuring out transit systems… I especially don’t like wading through lots of options figuring out food options. The net effect is that I’ve gradually gone sessile.</p>
